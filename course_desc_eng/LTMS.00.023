During the course the following topics are covered: multivariable functions, their limits, continuity, derivatives, directional derivatives, gradient, differentiability, total differential, tangetial plane and normal of a surface, differentiation of composite functsion; implicit functions, their differentiation; extrema of multivariable functions; line and surface integrals; multiple integrals; trigonometric Fourier series.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The students become acquainted with differential and integral calculus of several variables and the theory of Fourier series. To support the ability of critical thinking, developing mathematical oral self-expression skills. The student develops learning skills related to numbers and calculation throughout the topics and exercise types covered in the course. The student has gained support during preparation for oral examination (oral midterm exam, final exam).Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing this course every student: 1) is able to characterize boundedness of subsets and convergence of sequences in Rm; knows the definition of limit of functions of several variables and is able to apply it; 2) knows the link between partial derivatives and differentiability of functions; is able to prove the main theorems of differentiation; is able to find partial derivatives and full differential of noncomplicated functions of several functions; 3) is familiar with the notion of implicitly defined functions and is able to prove the main theorem for implicit functions of a single variable; is able to find extreme values of noncomplicated functions of several variables; 4) is familiar with the notion of length of a curve; knows the definitions of line integrals; is able to compute noncomplicated line integrals; 5) is able to define the double integral; knows the main properties of double integrals and the standard substitutions in double and triple integrals; is able to formulate and prove Green's theorem; 6) is familiar with the definition of the Fourier series for a piecewise smooth 2π-periodic function, is able to find the Fourier series for noncomplicated functions; is able to prove Riemann's lemma, the Dirichlet theorem on pointwise convergence of Fourier series; 7) chooses suitable mathematical conceptions for problems, and applies these conceptions while solving problems; 8) investigates and compiles logic reasonings within the framework of course material; 9) has discussed on mathematical conceptions (essence, proof, examples) in oral midterm and oral final exam.
