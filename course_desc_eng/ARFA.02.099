Pharmacy students are introduced to fundamentals of analytical chemistry starting with purity of substance, laboratory equipment, basic data analysis, properties of solvents, chemical equilibrium, dissociation and solubility. Sample of systematic qualitative analysis of cations based on formation of precipitates with acids and bases is presented. Methods 
of quantitative analysis based on titration and optical properties of substances are more thoroughly dealt with. Basics of electrochemical methods of end-point detection and voltammetry as well as methods based on separation like chromatography are also presented.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this subject is to introduce the pharmacy students to the basics of qualitative and quantitative analysis.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student that graduated the course:
- is able to handle laboratory glassware and basic instruments like pH-meter and spectrophotometer
- understands the basic chemical and physical theories the qualitative and quantitative analysis of medicines is based on
- is self-reliantly able to choose the proper analytical methods and to carry out basic analytical procedures of analysis of medicines, using either chemical techniques (titrations) or instrumental methods (spectrophotometry, TLC)
- is able to perform self-reliantly calculations necessary for experimental design and to statistically analyze experimental data to identify common patterns and trends
