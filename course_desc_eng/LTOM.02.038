The course is divided into four sections: (a) spatial planning as a means to leading the way for change, (b) social expectations and values as the basis of spatial planning, (c) the dynamics between parties invlolved in planning and (d) putting the planning strategy into practice. In-person lectures, online lectures and independent reading materials provide a theoretical background and place Estonian planning practices onto an international comparison scale. Through different tasks, groups of 4-5 students will carry out an analysis of a local government Master Plan approved recently and elaborate policy recommendations for the respective municipality. Meetings in the auditorium are complemented by groups meeting via an online meeting platform (e.g. Miro). The mission of this course is to provide participants with a better understanding of how spatial planning plays out in real governance situations - how social values are brought into the planning process, and what is the role of every involved party in this process.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is learning to think of social expectations through a spatial lens. The course will approach spatial planning as a means to lead change. We will learn to recognise opportunities for the currently dominating social values, in concurrence with various involved stakeholders and participants, to emerge into spatial planning decisions. Furthermore, we will practice critical evaluation of finalized planning documents and strategies as well as their long-term reliability, and prepare ourselves for creating spatial planning processes that are adaptable to the changing nature of social values.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing this course, the student is expected to: (1) understand the role of spatial planning in local and regional governance, and in leading and enabling social change; (2) identify the prevalence of widely established social values (or lack thereof) in spatial planning programmes and recognise the need for adaptability to changing social values; (3) is capable of accommodating spatial decisions with social expectations in a systematic, identifiable and inclusive way while taking different roles in the planning process; (4) is capable of critically analysing the reliability and performance of finalised spatial plans and spatial decisions outside the formal planning process.
