Students will practising main methods of synthesis, separation, purification and analysis of organic compounds and/or materials and laboratory equipment. Some simpler organic synthetic experiments will be carried out. The student develops skills mostly in laboratory practical work and is able to plan, describe, report the experimental work to reach to best results.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of course is to provide basic practical laboratory skills for the synthesis and characterization of organic compounds and/or materials.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student: -is able to safely perform simplest syntheses in the laboratory under supervision -is able to describe orally/written the practical work and the possible risks, thus can plan the time of the experiment -is able to design and use the basic laboratory equipment to perform various practical work -can use chemistry databases to find the chemical and physical properties of organic substances -knows the basic methods of isolation and purification of organic compounds -can synthesize the simplest organic compounds according to the instructions -can use simpler analytical methods to characterize organic compounds (melting and boiling points of substances, thin layer chromatography) -can describe the performed experiment both in writing and orally and give an evaluation of the obtained results -can correctly complete a lab notebook and prepare the written reports on organic synthesis.
