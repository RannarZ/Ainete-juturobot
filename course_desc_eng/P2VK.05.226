The 15 EAP practice takes place in a cultural organization. Within at least 4 weeks the students should work in the organization, observe, analyze and take part in organization's everyday work.
As an outcome of the practice there must be a cultural event that the student has been helping to prepare and carry out. The general goal is to put into practice the theoretical knowledge student has gained from curricula so far and use those skills to analyze a cultural organization and its obligations and also use the knowledge in real life practice. Implementing theoretical skills into practice is the key word!
