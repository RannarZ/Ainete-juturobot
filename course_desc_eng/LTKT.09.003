During the practical course, each student will conduct a single multi-step synthesis. Students will plan and perform their synthesis, purify and analyse final product(s). A report will be compiled and presented.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give the students practical knowledge about to plan and perform independently the modern synthesis as well the methods for determination of the purity and structure of compounds.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students should be able to plan the synthetic work from chemical and also from technical point of view. Students should know where to get and how to handle the chemical information (methods, mechanisms, properties, safety etc.), work with data bases. They should know how to evaluate different synthetic or separation methods. Students should know the modern method of purification of starting materials, products and solvents. Students should know the main methods of working with air and moisture sensitive compounds. Deep freezing and high heating. Students should be able independently to follow the synthesis processes using different methods and make the decision if neccessary. Students should see any details of experiment in order to take them into account in next steps or repeated syntheses. Students shoul know the methods for determination of the purity and structure of separated compounds. Students should be able to report hes (or her) work in any step of general project. Students should know how to write the report according to requirements, discuss it and do the presentation.
