The lectures and lab sessions (computational/experimental) will cover the necessary conceptual,
simulation, and experimental aspects for polarization imaging.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to introduce the concepts of polarization imaging of light followed by
hands on laboratory training (computational/experimental).Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Introduction to Polarization Imaging
At the end of the course, the student(s) will have
* An understanding of fundamentals of polarization of light, including simulation and
experimental aspects.
* Knowledge of characterization and use of polarization sensitive optical components (linear)
Objectives
Learning outcomes
polarizers, phase retarders, polarization camera, etc.).
* Skills to experimentally demonstrate generation and detection of different States of Polarization
(SOPs).
* Basics of polarization imaging techniques, Stokes polarimetry and Poincare sphere method.
* Skills to design polarization sensitive interferometers and extract phase information of complexvalued objects.
* Sufficient knowledge to apply polarimetric techniques into multidisciplinary fields, i.e., material
characterization, biomedical imaging, etc.
