The course starts up with the introduction of the electromagnetic field in terms of the effect on the potentially current-based performance of the device prototypes, as well as the physical quantities and units describing the field. Classification of the materials related to their diamagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic behavior will be given. The importance of the main parameters of the magnetic hysteresis curve - remnant induction, saturation and coercive force - will be emphasized. Temperature- and synthesis-dependent magnetization of the materials will be overviewed, as well as the problems connected to the scaling down the dimensions of the layered magnetic materials and improvement of their chemical purity. Principles of the magnetic information storage, memories and magnetic writing heads will be presented. Anisotropic and giant magnetic resistance will be characterized. Attention will be paid to the spintronics and its prospectives. Magnetic semiconducting materials will be briefed. The audience will become aware of some issues related to the deposition and technology of magnetic solid state materials and devices. Problems related to the reproducibility and reliability in terms of the preparation of nanodimensional materials demonstrating adequate magnetic behavior when grown over large areas or on nanoporous substrates in the form of nanorods or nanotubes will be addressed.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Physics behind the electromagnetic field as well as physical units used to describe the magnetic phenomena will be treated. The nomenclature of the magnetic materials will be given. Properties and applications of the magnetic materials will be described, with emphasis on the build-up and construction of the contemporary magnetoelectronic devices. Prospective materials allowing the creation of nanodimensional devices will be dealt with, as well as the problems related to the processing of such materials.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  In the end, the students will become introduced to the following: 1)	knowing the physical units and measurement methods relevant to the magnetic materials; 2)	chemical compounds and materials as constituents of the contemporary and advanced magnetic devices, as well as some of the fabrication methods of these materials; 3)	awareness of the configuration and working principles of devices based on magnetic information storage; 4)	knowledge on the current concepts of the development of devices based on the magnetic phenomena: scaling-down the dimensions of the planar devices, three-dimensional structures based on nanotubes and nanorods.
