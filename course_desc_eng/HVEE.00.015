There are two ways to complete the professional practice:
1) Do professional practice in one semester at one institution. To do this, register for the "Professional Practice of Estonian and Finno-Ugrian Linguistics" subject. If you want to start the practice in the middle of the semester or e.g. in the summer, write to the practice lecturer Ann Siiman (ann.siiman@ut.ee).
