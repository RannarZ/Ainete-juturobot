The lectures provide an overview of plant water relations, mineral nutrition, photosynthesis, respiration, growth and development, and interaction of these processes with ambient environment at an organismic level of organization.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course gives an introduction and overview of the molecular biology of plants. Herein, the concepts of photosynthesis, plant primary metabolism, water exchange, mineral nutrition, plant growth and development and interaction with the ambient environment will be covered.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completion of the course students: *	are able to explain main plant anatomical, morphological and biochemical adaptations to process basic plant functions - photosynthesis, water metabolism and mineral nutrition; *	understand how plants acquire, transport and hold water and what are the basic mechanisms to control water transport in different conditions; *	are able to explain how plants use light and water to produce sugars and what are the differences between C3, C4 and CAM photosynthesis; *	have acquired knowledge on plant nutrition by minerals and what is the concept of mineral absorption and inclusion into metabolism by membrane transport; *	are able to explain formation of plant anatomy and morphology from plant embryo and what hormones and phytochromes control these processes; *	knows the basic principles of plant hormone biology; *	knows the basic plant defence mechanisms against biotic stress.
