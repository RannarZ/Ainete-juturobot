Using the calculus of variations, the Newtonian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation of the dynamics is presented. The symmetry and conservation laws are based on the conceptions of the modern physics.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this course is to give an overview of the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalism and their theoretical and practical applications in classical mechanics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  At the end of this course the student:

*Has knowledge of Newtonian mechanics, the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalism in classical mechanics, inc. the terminology, main equations and theorems.

*Can show the equivalence of different approaches, knows how to derive Lagrange's equations from d'Alembert's principle and show the connection between Hamilton's principle and Lagrange's equations. 

*Can describe conservation laws in all aforementioned formalisms, inc. can formulate Noether's theorem in classical mechanics.

*Is familiar with the main symmetries and their properties.

*Is able to formulate and analyze simple problems of mechanics with the help of the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalism and can choose a suitable approach.
