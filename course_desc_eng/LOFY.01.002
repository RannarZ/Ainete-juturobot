The course is targeted to the quick and efficient introduction of the main principles of the current physics (matter and field, fermions and bosons, absolute speed, energy minimum, etc.), whereas the previous knowledge in physics is not required. The main goal is to create the mental constructs to envision physical processes. In most important cases, the examples are illustrated considering the application of the mathematical methods in physics. It is also important to note that the absolute mathematic formalness is not pursued.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main goal of the course is to introduce the physics as the integrity, and the role of physics in the generation of the observer's personal understanding of the Nature.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of this course, the student is expected to:
1. Cognize physics as a science that investigates the most general causal relationships, generates the models of natural phenomena and broadens the internal and external limits of vision;
2. Express the basic principles of the physical concept of the nature (such as atomistic principle, energetic minimum, absolute speed, wave-particle dualism, uncertainty principle), and refer to their exertion;
3. Use the vocabulary introduced at the lectures during the scientific discussions, make difference between important and unimportant information, and apply physical terminology in a correct way;
4. Possess the knowledge considering the mathematical background and calculus necessary for the description of physical processes (e.g., graphical representations, differentiation and integration, application of complex numbers), and recognize the main attributes and occurrence conditions of main functions present in physics (e.g., linear, power, exponent, harmonic); 5. Know the basic definitions belonging to the current physical concept of the world within the limits of the vocabulary (30 pages of A4 format) available on the web page of the course;
6. Solve the physical problems within the limits of example exercises available via the web support of the course.
