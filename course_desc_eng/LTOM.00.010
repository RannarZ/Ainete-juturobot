The course will consists of the thematic blocks (see below) and all lectures (except the first one) are divided to four parts: part 1 - general introduction to the morphology, ecology and systematics of the taxa (phyla, classes, orders) or to the abiotic and biotic (mainly flostical and bryological) characteristics of European biomes; part 2 - identification of the 10-20 species, (mostly) based on photographs; part 3 - presentation of the students concerning some of the most well-known species from the respective groups; part 4 - synthesis, where the species handled in part 3 are treated in more detail, concerning their interactions, place in the ecosystems, summaries of management plans and so on. 

Thematic blocks (lecturer in parentheses):
1st lecture - introduction (Toomas Esperk);
2-4 - protists (Kalle Olli);
5-13 - mosses and vascular plants (Ene Kook);
14-17 - fungi (Kadri Põldmaa, Irja Saar);
18-19 - lichens (Inga Jüriado);
20-25 - aquatic invertebrates (Taavi Virro);
26-31 - terrestrial invertebrates (Toomas Esperk)
32-37 - vertebrates; including 32-33 - fish (Lauri Saks), 34 - amphibians and reptiles, 35 - birds (Ants Tull), 36-37 - mammals (Harri Valdman)Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course aims to give a systematic overview about the anatomy, ecology and species diversity of Estonian and European protists, plants, mosses, lichens, fungi and animals.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course the student can: 1) characterize the anatomy and ecology of and construct the phylogenetic relationships between the main groups of Estonian and European protists, lichens, fungi and animals; 2) outline the main biomes in Europe and their abiotical and biotical characteristics; 3) recognize and characterize the set of protist, plant, moss, lichen, fungal and animal species that are occurring in Estonia and elsewhere in Europe; 4) characterize the anatomy, ecology, distribution and importance of some well known Estonian and European protist, plant, moss, lichen, fungal and animal species; 5) analyze the role of some well known Estonian and European protist, plant, moss, lichen, fungal and animal species in the ecosystems where they are living.
