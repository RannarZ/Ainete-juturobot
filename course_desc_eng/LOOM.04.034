Topic 4: Ecology of deep-water areas
Topic 5: Ecology of coastal ecosystems
Topic 6: Reefs
Topic 7: Streams and rivers: one-way water flow systems
Topic 8: Lakes and oceans as functional wholes
Topic 9: Aquatic ecosystems and global ecology
Topic 10: Impacts of human activities on aquatic ecosystems
Topic 11: History of lakes (Paleolimnology)Objectives/eesmärkid:  Students will learn the basic knowledge and concepts of hydrobiology. During the course, they will acquire an overview of different aquatic ecosystems, groups of hydrobionts, and the environmental factors that affect them. Students will come to an understanding of the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. They will become aware of the interrelationships between aquatic ecosystems, global climate phenomena and human activities.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon successful completion of the course, the students will: * Know the basic concepts of hydrobiology and the basic principles of the operation of hydrobiological processes and connections. * Know the main groups of hydrobionts and can point out the adaptations of hydrobionts to aquatic biotopes and their relationships with environmental factors. * Be able to give examples of relationships between hydrobionts, food chains and understand the mechanisms that control them. * Have an overview of different aquatic ecosystems, their structure, and the factors that shape it. * Be able to find and explain the connections between aquatic ecosystems, human activities and global climate phenomena. * Be able to understand specific hydrobiological problems in a wider socio-economic or global ecological context, as well. * Be able to independently find the necessary information, critically analyse it and relate it to previously acquired knowledge.
