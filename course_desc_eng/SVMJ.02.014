Projects are on   webpage (praktika.ut.ee) where the student has the opportunity to join a project team.

The project team consists of five to 10 students. The subject is partly web-based, and the Moodle environment outlines step-by-step activities related to analyzing both the project and the student's own development.

As a general rule, the project is carried out independently by the student's team. The level of students autonomy in the implementation of the project is discussed with the client/supervisor before the start of the project. Supervisor or client support is guaranteed throughout the project.

The following seminars are compulsory for the student:
1.	Introductory seminar (giving an overview of expectations, discussing essential points for the project, etc.)
2.	mid-term seminar (mid-term review and mid-term reporting)
3.	final seminar (presentation and discussion of results, self-assessment, feedback from supervisor/client).
The student prepares self-analysis based on STARR methodology to support learning from his/her experience and to improve his/her career.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to apply professional knowledge and skills to implement a project (including achieving a result) in a real working environment within interdisciplinary teams and within the time and resources defined by the project.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student:
