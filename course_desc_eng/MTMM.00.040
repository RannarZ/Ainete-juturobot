The second part of main algebra course. Groups. Rings. Polynomials in several variables. The main theorem of algebra. Functionals and forms. The Jordan normal form of a matrix. Finite abelian groups.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give (as the continuation of the course "Algebra I") additional information on vector spaces and polynomials and to give an introduction to (mainly abelian) groups and functionals (and forms corresponding to them).Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the course a student knows: 1.	basic concepts of the theory of algebraic structures (substructures, homomorphism, isomorphism, direct product); 2.	the constructions of factor groups and factor rings and the cjharacterization of cyclic groups; 3.	polynomial rings in several variables and the main theorem on symmetric polynomials; 4.	the proof of the main theorem of algebra; 5.	the proof of the existence a canonical basis of a linear transformation; 6.	basics of the theory of linear and bilinear functional; 7.	the proof of the existence a canonical basis of a quadratic functional and is able to find a canonical form of a given quadratic form.
