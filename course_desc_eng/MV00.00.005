The purpose of the practice is to complement the student's knowledge of general medicine, to assure strong and extensive basic knowledge that will allow the student to study any specialty of their choice. Clinical practice is a subject which needs and applies the previously acquired theoretical knowledge. During clinical practice, you can participate in appointments and solve most common problems the patients come to the family physician with, participate in planning and conducting prophylactic work and do home visits.
You need to finish 8 weeks of family medicine cycle in a family medicine practice. For the family medicine practice, the student needs to find a suitable practice place on their own. Every family physician or family medicine practice in Estonia or an abroad representor of the specialty or facility with a similar profile is suitable. Family medicine can additionally be taken as an extracurricular cycle and the prerequisite is the practice base's agreement to take the student.
Seminaries of family medicine cycle will be carried out electronically in the study environment of Moodle, where you need to choose and analyse 1 cases and present them for discussion in a set work group. Additional assignments are specified under the relevant chapter of the diary.
Everything that the student has learned during the five years can be used in practical work in family medicine. During the family medicine practice the student can do family doctor`s everyday work: resolve different problems in different age and gender groups, make home visits and do preventive work and give advice towards changing patient lifestyle.
The student has to solve at least 100 specialty questions on AMBOSS study platform during the family medicine cycle. Solving the questions will be checked at the end of the semester.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Practice goals:
