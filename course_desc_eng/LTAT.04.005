In this course, the student will gain practical research experience by applying themselves to a to concrete research work connected with the research at the chair for Security and Theoretical Computer Science (e.g., deriving a mathematical result, developing/implementing an algorithm/software, etc.) The direction and content of the project is agreed upon with a supervisor.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The objective of the course is to give students knowledge and skills for performing research in theoretical computer science and related areas. The students shall get an understanding how research is performed by applying themselves to concrete research work connected with the research at the chair for Security and Theoretical Computer Science (e.g., deriving a mathematical result, developing/implementing an algorithm/software, etc.)Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  On successful completion of this course, the students will have learned: - to apply theoretical knowledge learned in lectures to a bigger research-related problem - to interact with other researchers (e.g., their supervisor) and to communicate research problems and solutions - to work independently (but under the guidance of a supervisor) on an open-ended problem
