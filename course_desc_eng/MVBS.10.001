The course provides theoretical and practical basis of knowledge about general pathological processes and pathomorphological alterations, necessary for proceeding into the study of clinical disciplines. In the course the basic mechanisms and morphological changes of general pathological processes (cell injury, adaptations, the body's means of response and reparation, circulatory disorders) and tumors will be covered, emphasizing practical diagnostic meaning of these changes in most wide-spread diseases such as cardiovascular, inflammatory and neoplastic. 
The study is perfomed in team based learning seminars. For independent study serve the textbooks and presentations, videolectures and self-assessment tests represented in the Moodle learning platform. For learning of microscopic alterations, the database of digital microscopy slides with tutorial videos is available in the Moodle, grouped according to the topics. In the practical classes, discussions of independently learnt materials takes place and drawing associations with pathogenesis of disease as well as clinical significance.
Macroscopic alterations are mostly introduced in practical classes by using the native preparations. For recapitulation of theoretical material, a database of macroscopic preparations is available in the Moodle. In seminars and practical classes, description of cases, their analysis and integrating into formulation of diagnostic hypothesis is practiced both orally and in group activities.
Participation in seminars and practical classes is mandatory. The students have to complete all tests, assessments and practical tasks by terms.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of pathological anatomy course is to provide integrated theoretical and practical knowledge about the causes (etiology), the mechanisms by which a causative agent leads to disease (pathogenesis) and the associated alterations of structure (pathomorphology). In the study, the student will develop the skills of observation, interpretation, and integration needed to analyze human disease; to develop comprehensive medical reasoning so that the student would become able to explain the pathogenesis of morphological lesions and understand their clinical symptoms and consequences.  The course is a prerequisite for clinical disciplines in 4.-5. years and preparing for work as a general practitioner.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who graduated the course getting at least the minimal grade: knows terms, definitions and names of most important diagnoses in pathological anatomy; is able to make associations between macroscopic or microscopic pathomorphological changes and their etiopathogenetic mechanisms as well as clinical symptoms and functional consequences to the organism; can formulate logically the pathogenetic reasoning of the diseases; is able to distinguish pathomorphological changes of the most frequent diseases from normal findings, create diagnostic hypotheses and evaluate them in the context of clinical classifications; has experience of collaboration within a group; is adaptable and motivated of self-development.
