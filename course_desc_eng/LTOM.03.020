Theoretical problems of solid waste generation, their properties and main areas of their secondary beneficial use in main industrial processes are discussed. Practical training of the research methods of solid wastes composition and properties is conducted.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give knowledge of the most important solid waste fluxes in industrial processes and ways of their beneficiation and/or use as secondary raw materials.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Successful student must: 1. have a knowledge about main types of solid industrial wastes  and their physical-chemical properties 2. knows the main areas of application of solid waste products and typical technologies of their processing and beneficiation. 3. knows and is able to use theoretical knowledge in practically laboratory studies and for planning the solid waste valorization.
