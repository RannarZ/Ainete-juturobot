The course deals with sediment investigation methods, used in studies of sedimentary environments (hydrodynamics, water depth, salinity, temperature, climate), with lateral and secular (incl cyclic) changes in sedimentation, and with methodology of compilation of facies maps, profiles and models. Origin and sedimentary environments of Estonian carbonate and oil shale deposits is studied in comparison with excamples from the World. Basics of sequence stratigraphy is given. The course includes practical excercises in basin analysis and sequence stratigraphy.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give knowledge on study methods of sedimentary basins and environments.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Succesful student must: 1) know main investigation methods for sedimentary environment analysis 2) have basic knowledge about cyclic sedimentary processes 3) read and compile facies maps and models.  4) know basics of sequence stratigraphy. 5) be able to subdivide simple sedimentary successions into sequences and tracks.
