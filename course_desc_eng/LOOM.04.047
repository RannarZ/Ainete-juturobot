The aim of this course is to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of physiology in invertebrates as well as vertebrates and introduce specific adaptations (types of locomotions, camouflage, feeding techniques, deep diving, poisons and venoms etc) of animals living in different environments. The students participate in  practical works to have a closer look at physiological methods in measuring stress in vertebrates and immunity in insects.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this course is to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of physiology in invertebrates as well as vertebrates and introduce specific adaptations (types of locomotions, camouflage, feeding techniques, deep diving, poisons and venoms etc) of animals living in different environments.
