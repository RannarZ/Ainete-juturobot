A traditional introductory course in Measure Theory and Lebesgue Integration. Included topics are: measure spaces, Lebesgue measure, measurable functions, Lebesgue integral and convergence theorems, modes of convergence of measurable functions, product measures.Objectives/eesmärkid:  An introductory course in Measure Theory and Lebesgue Integration.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  On successful completion of this course, students will: 
1) Understand and be able to manipulate with the central concepts  of modern measure theory: sigma-algebras, Borel sets,  measures, completeness and regularity of a measure, "almost everywhere", measurable functions,
integral;
2) Know the Caratheodory-Hahn procedure of extending a measure from an algebra to the sigma-algebra generated by it, and how this procedure applies to produce the Lebesgue-Stieltjes' measures on the real line;
3) Understand the spaces Lp(µ), 1≤p≤∞;
4) Know the relationships between Lebesgue and Riemann integration;
5) Know the relationships between different modes of convergence of measurable functions;
6) State and prove the major theorems of measure theory: Caratheodory's Theorem, Monotone Convergence Theorem, Fatou's Lemma, Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem, Egorov's Theorem;
7) Know how product sigma-algebras and product measures (in particular, the Lebesgue measure in Rn) are generated, and be able to apply the Fubini-Tonelli Theorems.
