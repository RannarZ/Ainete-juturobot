The aim of the class is to give an overview of physical basics, methods, and technologies of the Earth's solid, water and gaseous environment monitoring, data acquisition techniques and environmental modeling methods. Attention is paid to: Measuring and registration of physical parameters of environment; Measuring devices and technologies; Contact and remote monitoring methods; Data acquisition technology; Physical and mathematical models of environmental state.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Give an introduction to physics-based methods of environmental monitoring technology.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student understands the main physical processes affecting the environment and knows the methods applied in the monitoring of atmosphere, hydrosphere, litosphere and biosphere. She/he knows the possibilities of contact monitoring and remote sensing and is able to choose between them or to combine them, if needed; understands the positions of measurement and modelling in monitoring and can combine these methods flexibly in practice.
