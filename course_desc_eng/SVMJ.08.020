The topics discussed are the following:
1. Possibilities of using fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic for modeling in economics and techniques 
2. Fundamentals of fuzzy modeling methodology
3. Basic concepts of fuzzy set theory 
4. Sequence of main stages of fuzzy modeling
5. Fuzzy inference rules and inference algorithms
6. Review of computer tools and special software products for fuzzy modeling.Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course provides a review of the theoretical foundations and applied methods of new modern technology of mathematical modeling of management, production, and broader economic problems - fuzzy modeling - in the context of solving practical problems of economic analysis, marketing, logistics, management, and creation and use of software and information technology. The purpose of the course is to provide practitioners and students, including masters, and graduate students with opportunities to learn the basics of fuzzy set theory and practical skills in fuzzy modeling.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The course presents material selected and tested on real problems, which gives students the opportunity to independently determine the ways and methods of applying fuzzy modeling. It is envisaged to provide the necessary theoretical foundations to the extent necessary to understand the basic ideas of fuzzy modeling. The construction and analysis of fuzzy models of specific applied practical problems is aimed at illustrating the peculiarities of the implementation of fuzzy modeling, in particular in the MATLAB environment, and specialized tools to support fuzzy modeling.
