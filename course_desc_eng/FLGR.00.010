The doctoral seminar focuses on the discussion of the newest research results that are related to the ongoing research of doctoral students enrolled in the course. Seminars also provide an in-depth introduction to specific core text in language and literature study and discuss their possible applications in different disciplines. Students are given the opportunity to present their research and work in progress, to get feedback from their fellow students and instructors. The specific content of seminars and the readings are determined at the beginning of every semester, depending on the interests and needs of the enrolled students.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the doctoral seminar is to develop the students' ability to critically analyse the newest theories and research results that are related to the research topics of their doctoral dissertations and to draw parallels with other disciplines of the institute and their research areas. The seminars have two primary aims. First, to provide an in-depth introduction to core text in language and literature study or newest research in the fields and discuss their possible applications in different disciplines. Second, students are given the opportunity to present their research and work in progress, to get feedback from their fellow students and instructors.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students acquire in-depth understanding of the recent theories and research results in their research field as well as of the core texts of language and literature studies. They are able to relate these works to their own research and to other disciplines of the institute. The reading and discussion of theoretical texts develops students' skills of critical and analytical reading and thinking. Students get feedback on their developing theses and learn to incorporate the criticism in their work and thus express themselves better in the academic context. By delivering presentations students improve their skills of public speaking and argumentation. The seminar supports students in writing their theses and prepares them for the defence of the theses.
