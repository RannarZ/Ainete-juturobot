The course is an eye-opener to understand the hidden, often enigmatic life of algae, their structure, function, and role in the ecosystem. The course starts with lectures, and proceeds intermingled with seminars. A mandatory part of the course is written seminar work, which also has to be presented as an oral talk (max 10 min). This trains writing and presentation skills, as well as giving feed-back to others presentations. The course material is made available electronically. The seminar work requires analysis of a few regular research papers, which can be chosen by the student, or will be given by the tutor.Objectives/eesmärkid:  An overview about the evolutionary systematics of algae, their role in the biosphere and ecosystem.
