It is possible to perform the internship in two directions: 
1) publishing of an critical review in cultural journal; 
2) practical conceptualization of the process of criticism (submission to the anthology of criticism or to Estonian Writers Online Dictionary (EWOD).

The aim of practice is to experience the publishing process of a critical text starting from choosing the work to be criticized till the publication of the analysis in some cultural publication.

The practice includes colloquies in the course of which the students get acquainted with the principles of  writing a critical text and the demands of different publications for a text of criticism. After that the student chooses a work (an original work of fiction, translation, a collection of articles, etc.) he/she wiskes to criticize, and the publication where he/she wants to do it (Keel ja Kirjandus, Sirp, Vikerkaar, Akadeemia, Looming, Postimees, Eesti Päevaleht, Värske Rõhk). The studnet is supervised by the university teacher together with the editor of the given publication. Creating and organizing databases (fro example compiling and commenting a critical anthology or some other lexicon of the literary meta-level) offers practical interpretation of the process of criticism.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To enable students an opportunity to practice writing of literary critique.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  1) knows the principles of compilation, styles and functions of texts of criticism;
