The aim of the course is to familiarize students with microeconometrics suitable for individual level data on the economic behavior of individuals or firms using regression methods for cross section and panel data. The course starts with an introduction of maximum likelihood method and generalized method of moments. Then modelling of various qualitative and limited (censored and truncated) dependent variables is discussed. The following models are covered: binary logit and probit, multinomial logit and probit, ordered probit and logit, tobit mudel, Heckman selection models, Poisson and Negbin count data models, Cox and parametric duration models. Panel data methods are discussed: within-group estimator, between-group estimator, random effects estimator, Arellano-Bond estimator. Theoretical aspects are discussed during the lectures and empirical examples are studied in computer classes using econometric program R.
