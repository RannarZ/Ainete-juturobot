An applied project in the form of participation in an autonomous-vehicles competition. Or a research project in the domain of autonomous vehicles, agreed upon with supervisor.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Autonomy, in the context of autonomous vehicles, is the ability of a vehicle to operate without the intervention of a human operator. Such vehicles constitute a very broad spectrum of shapes and sizes including, for instance, vacuum cleaning robots, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) operating on factory floors and warehouses, and robot taxis etc. The objective of the course is to give students knowledge in the area of autonomous vehicles, by participating in an autonomous-vehicles project. This can either be an applied project in the form of participation in an autonomous-vehicles competition, or a research project on an advanced sub-area of autonomous vehicles research.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of the course a student will be able to: I.	use a systematic approach for an applied or research project. II.	plan the project with appropriate milestones and timeline.  III.	work and interact with the supervisor and team members.  IV.	report the findings in written form and communicate them orally.
