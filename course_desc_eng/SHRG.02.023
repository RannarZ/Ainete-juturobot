Inter-group conflicts that are based on ethnically defined social boundaries remain a salient issue in today's world and prevent states from establishing lasting political and economic conditions for peace and growth. Not just the post-colonial world is frequently errupting in violence between groups that define themselves in ethnic, religious or linguistic terms; also other parts of the world, including the developed democracies are witnessing minority rights movements and ethnic separatism that challenge the status quo of the established nation-states. Finally, different migration waves and mass immigration into the rich "Western" democracies since the mid-20th century have put established understandings and practices of citizenship, democratic representation and justice into question calling for new ways of thinking both theoretically and practically about diversity management and social integration. But what exactly motivates individuals to identify with an ethnic group? What explains the resilience of ethnic identities and their seemingly easy political mobilization? And how can democratic states manage ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity without using violence or other forms of coercion? The course will address these and many other questions, focusing both on theoretical debates about ethnicity, ethnic group formation and conflict as well as on specific ethnopolitical regimes and modes of conflict regulation instituted in countries around the world.Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course will examine different ways in which democratic states can regulate and accommodate ethnocultural diversity. It will cover a wide range of cases and policies, discussing the pros and cons of various ethnopolitical regimes against the normative and institutional requirements of democratic governance.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completing the course, students: - analyse ongoing debates over ethnicity and the salience of ethnic identities as well as their mobilization in the modern world;  - reconstruct the complex ethnopolitical situations in different countries and identify different modes of ethnic conflict regulation by democratic states;  - demonstrate research skills by investigating and reporting on specific country cases of ethnic conflict regulation;  - formulate relevant questions from the reading and organise a class discussion;  - reflect in writing on the concepts discussed and develop a sound position on critical questions.
