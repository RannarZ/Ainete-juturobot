During the internship, the student becomes acquainted with various aspects of the physicists professional work (work organization, technology, quality control, etc.). He or she selects the place for the internship himself or herself, preferably with the help of the supervisor of the Masters thesis and confirms the suitability of the subject with the responsible lecturer. Practicing outside the home university is preferred. If the internship is about carrying out a specific innovative project, it is also allowed to conduct the internship in your own research group.

During the internship, the student performs tasks requiring a physicist qualification and gets an overview of the production, research, development or teaching work done at the internship.

Finally, the student submits a written report outlining the activities and problems he or she encountered during the internship. The template of the report is provided in Moodle course and must be submitted by email at least two weeks before the expected time of defense. The defense must take place before the official end of the semester. The internship ends with an oral presentation at a related institute's seminar. The student organizes the seminar by contacting the organizer of the specific seminar. The student also contacts the responsible lecturer to arrange suitable times for everybody.

In order to pass the subject, the student must pass both the practice report and the defense.
