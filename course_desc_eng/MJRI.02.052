The course includes various quantitative methods than can be exploited for solving economic problems. The following distinct topics will be covered: the formulation of problems, most relevant solution methods (graphical method, simplex method, transportation simplex method), the solution of assignments in computers (PC-s) and the analysis of obtained results.Objectives/eesmärkid:  After taking the course students will have acquired both theoretical knowledge and practical experience related to the usage of mathematical models for analyzing economic problems and finding optimal plans. The are expected to able to both choose between different alternative solution methods as well as use results obtained from solving the models for making decisions in practice.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After taking the course the student has acquired the following skills and competencies
·	Knows different mathematical models and methods, and their substance
·	Is able to present the problems found in economic practice in the form of the mathematical model of the situation
·	Is able to choose the appropriate mathematical method or methods in order to solve that particular problem
·	Is able to use the chosen mathematical methods and to interpret the acquired results
·	Knows how to use the results of mathematical modelling for decision-making
