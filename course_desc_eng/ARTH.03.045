The course includes following topics: Generalized linear models and their extensions, Model specification, estimation of parameters and
assessment of precision, model critique, Models for description, prediction, and causal inference; control of confounding, evaluation of effect-modification, Normal linear regression model for continuous outcomes, Models for binary outcomes with link functions related to risk differences, risk ratios, and odds ratios.
Poisson regression models and (Cox) proportional hazards model for incidence rates and survival data. Conditional logistic regression for matched case-control data. Overdispersion, quasi-likelihood, random effects models, and other extensions.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course aims at teaching the application of advanced statistical modeling (incl prognosis models) in public health.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students will be expected - to be able to choose statistical models for data analysis - to be able to use different statistical models that would account for confounding and effect-modification
