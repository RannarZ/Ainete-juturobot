Students are expected to present their findings individually and also as members of their group. Based on practical examples, the module thus provides an overview of how clinical nutritionists can contribute to the optimisation of treatment regimens by using and applying their knowledge. As before, learners are tested informally with short interactive quizzes. The metabolic response to stress is a large part of what determines disease-related malnutrition.
