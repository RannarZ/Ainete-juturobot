First, the course gives the basic characteristics of plasma as a specific state of the matter. Then an overview of basic elementary processes of excitation and ionisation processes is given. The main attention is paid to the non-equilibrium plasma and to distribution functions characterising its charged particles. Experimental methods used for determination of plasma parameters are described. The part of low temperature plasma applications contains methods of thin film deposition, osonators, laser medium, environmental applications.

The topics of the lecture are acquired by independent work which is controlled by weekly Moodle tests and discussed together with fellow students and the lecturer in weekly seminars. Each student prepares a presentation on a topic chosen together with the teacher, which will be presented in the seminar at the end of the course. The course ends with an oral exam.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course passes the basic knowledge of plasma as the fourth state of matter. The main plasma-describing parameters are introduced. The main attention is paid to the non-equilibrium plasma and its application in surface treatment and solving of environmental problems. High temperature plasma as a triggering source of thermonuclear reaction is described.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing the course, the student: * defines on the basis of fundamental plasma parameters, when the ionized environment can be considered plasma as the fourth aggregate state of matter; * describes the main loss and generation mechanisms of charge carriers and prepares the rate equations for plasma chemical reactions; * distinguishes the main types of non-equilibrium gas discharge plasma and describes their formation mechanisms and most important applications; * explains the main methods of plasma diagnostics and their areas of use. As transferable skills, the student: * orients in the specialized terminology and literature on plasma physics; * develops oral self-expression skills by preparing and presenting a presentation on a chosen topic to other students and the lecturer; * develops the skills to study independently;
