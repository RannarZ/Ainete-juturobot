In order to understand the modern Middle East it is crucial to appreciate the role that religion has played in the societies of this region since antiquity. The course will examine the main historical-cultural bases (Canaanite, Arabic, Indo-European and North-African) of the Middle-Eastern societies and the way in which religion has functioned in these societies. We will explore the topic through a broad thematic and chronological scope - an optic that allows students to appreciate both continuities and changes in the middle-eastern societies.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main objective of the course is to introduce students to the wide-reaching relevance of historical-cultural influences and of religion to the character and composition of societies in the Middle East since antiquity. Through a wide chronological and geographical lens, students will gain insight into the roles and dynamics that religion plays in modern societies in the Middle East. The aim of the course is also to show how religious and temporal power are contingent on the cultural contexts in which they emerge and to introduce these contexts to the students.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student will *	be familiar with the main cultural regions and religions in the Middle East, *	gain deeper understanding of  the role of religion in the past and present of the Middle East, *	be able to demonstrate critical independent and reflective thought in discussions about the region, *	develop a comparative viewpoint when analysing the various societies and religious systems in the Middle East, *	be able to communicate his/her understanding of knowledge about the topic in a concise and clear way both in written and oral form.
