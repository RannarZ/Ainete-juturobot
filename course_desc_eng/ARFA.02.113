All the main scientific and technological aspects of the design and manufacture of dosage forms.
A practical study of preparation, efficacy and evaluation of extemporary pharmaceutical dosage forms.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aims of  the course are the following:  - to learn the principles of dosage form classification and disain; - to learn and understand the scientific and technological aspects of the design and manufacture of dosage forms; - to prepare and/or manufacture and analyze different pharmaceutical dosage forms (powders, solutions, colloidal solutions, suspensions, emulsions, ointments, creams, tablets, suppositories etc.) on a small (compounding - ex tempore) and intermediate (pilot-scale) scale.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student need to: - know the design and formulation of dosage forms; - understand of the basic physico-chemical processes by manufacturing of dosage forms; - know how the excipients and used technology of formulation are connected with quality of dosege form;  - understand how the dosage form affects the rate and extent of drug absorption into the body;  - can compound dosege forms (ex tempore and pilot-scale) in good quality; - know the avoidance and elimination of microorganisms in dosage forms; - know product perfomance testing (quality testing, stability testing).
