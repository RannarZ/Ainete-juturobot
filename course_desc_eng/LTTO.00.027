In the beginning of the course students can select a topic which they start to solve in a smaller group. Every group has a supervisor. Course is based on a problem based learning method. Additionally lectures about various remote sensing applications will be held.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Course will focus on various methods and applications used in remote sensing of environment. Overview will be given about passive and active remote sensing. Students will learn how to combine data from various origin and sources to analyse the changes in environment.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the end of the course: - students have the overview about principles used in passive, radar and lidar remote sensing and their respective application fields; - knows the principles of spectral measurements (knows the terms spectrometer, radiance, irradiance, reflectance, atmospheric correction, calibration), - knows the principles in water remote sensing (bio-optical modelling, adjacency effect) - knows the principles in vegetation remote sensing (optical properties of the leaf, contribution of various features to the reflectance, leaf angles, various indices). - student knows how to download, process and analyse remote sensing and possibly ancillary data and apply this knowledge to solve various exercises. - understands the differences in remote sensing and field data, how to combine them and use for spatio-temporal analyses and supporting the sustainable development goals (SDG) and international environmental frameworks. - have gained experience how to plan and conduct groupwork, share responsibilities inside small group, present results.
