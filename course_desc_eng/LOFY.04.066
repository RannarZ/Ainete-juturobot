The seminar is an addition to the courses of theoretical physics. Topical reviews on the problems of modern theoretical physics are  presented by different lecturers. The main form of the work for a student is the preparation of a report on some topical problem of theoretical physics  based on the analysis literature or on her/his own scientific research. The course is meant Master Students  in  fundamental physics.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The purpose of the seminar is to give students an experience of working through scientific information and presenting it in an oral presentation with slides. Another aim of the seminar is to broaden the students' understanding of various topics in theoretical physics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  student acquires - an experience in working through scientific information and preparing it for presentation in logical manner, - an experience in giving a presentation with mathematical content, - an experience in giving an oral presntation using computer slides or blackboard, - broader view into a range of current problems in theoretical physics.
