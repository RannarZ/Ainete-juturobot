In the course of Solid State Theory, the mathematical description of crystal structures, crystal lattice dynamics and the related properties of materials are considered. The quantum mechanical theory of electron states in solids is presented and the relevant electrical, magnetic and optical phenomena are modelled. The effects caused by electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions are also treated.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to give a systematic survey about the theoretical foundations of contemporary solid state physics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of the course, the student: - knows the methods of the quantum statistics applied in the present course; - knows the theoretical foundations of the description of crystal structures and the dynamics of crystal lattice; - knows the principles of the description of electron states in crystals; - understands the quantum-physical background of the electron and phonon properties of crystal; - knows the foundations electron band theory; - understands the role of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in crystals.
