The course consists of seminars. We will read fragments from the works of F. Nietzsche, A. Camus, J.-P. Sartre, M. Heidegger, S. Freud, C. Jung, M. Foucault, J. Derrida, J. Peterson and P. Sloterdijk and analyze them in their philosophical and historical contexts. Topics and concepts that will be discussed and investigated include: death of god, the Dionysian, nihilism, existential rebellion, individual responsibility, deconstruction, death of man and author, differential philosophy of language and eventually critique of postmodernism and identity politics.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The impact of F. Nietzsche's philosophy on the 20th and 21st century has been rather extraordinary. In the first half of the 20th Century, this impact revealed itself mainly in existential philosophy (A. Camus, J.-P. Sartre, M. Heidegger etc.) and psychoanalysis (S. Freud, C. Jung etc.), in the second half of the Century above all in poststructuralism and postmodernism (M. Foucault, J. Derrida, G. Deleuze). In the 21st century, he is often being referred to in relation to the concept of post-truth. But also J. Peterson, the present-day critic of poststructuralism and postmodernism, has claimed to have been greatly influences by Nietzsche's philosophy. One of the guiding questions of the course is how it is possible that one thinker can influence so diverse ways of thinking. The aim of the course is to throw light on some of the important schools of thought in the 20th and 21st century that have been influenced by Nietzsche thinking, to explain the historical background of these schools and explain their emergence. This should enable students to have a better understanding of the present.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student who has passed the course has a good grasp of F. Nietzsche's philosophy and understands its impact on the 20th and 21st century. At the same time, the student understands the main arguments and historical context of existentialism, poststructuralism as well as some of the more recent schools of thought. In the end, the student will acquire a better understanding of the present culture and society.
