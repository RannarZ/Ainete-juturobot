The goal of the course is to provide understanding of principles of physical measurements. The main components of measuring instruments will be introduced. Students will learn about the limiting factors of measurement and about methods of accuracy enhancement. After the course, the students are expected to know the principles of measurement of length, velocity, acceleration, vibration, time, mass, force, deformation, pressure, viscosity, temperature, heat, electrical quantities, and optical quantities. They are expected to be able to conduct the measurement of physical quantities, to be able to assess the measurement accuracy and to be able to design a measuring apparatus on the basis of available sensor(s) and electronic components.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The knowledge about principles of the measurement of physical quantities is providedLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students should acquire the knowledge of the following.
1. The  main constituent parts of the apparatus for physical measurements. The parameters characterizing the accurcy and sensitivity of the instruments and their limiting factors (different sources of noise). 
2. The various methods of enchancement of selectivity, accuracy and sensitivity (lock-in amplifier, modulation and demodulation of the signal, filtering and averaging, correlation analysis). 
3. The principles and apparatud for measuring the following physical quantities:
- temperature, heat quantity, heat conductivity. Thermography and its usage
- length, area, volume
- position in space (geopositioning)
- angle, triangulation
- velocity, acceleration, vibration
- sound
- time and frequency
- mass, density
- force, torque (rotational moment), pressure
- dynamical properties of gases and liquids (fow rate, viscosity)
- electrical parameters (voltage, current, resistance, power)
- photometric and radiometric quantities, color
4. Principles of physical measurement applications in medicine (different types of tomography, encephalography, blood pressure, bio-potential).
