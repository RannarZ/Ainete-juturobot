The course provides theoretical and practical knowledge about basic basic movement and the principles of assessment of movement. Students will know how to analyse basic movements and they will know how to apply functional anatomy and the principles of normal movement.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal is to teach the student to analyse basic human movements and provide the student with the knowledge about different phases of the movement and the normal movement patterns required to peform basic movements.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student:
- understands the terminology used for describing human positions and movements.
- knows the principles of functional anatomy and normal human movement.
- evaluates human positions in different planes, distinguishing misalignement from normal alignment.
-divides basic human movements (eg transfers, gait and grasping) into phases.
- is able to describe main components of each phase and distinguish pathological movement patterns from the norm and is  able to document all of the beforementioned using correct professional language.
- searches for scientific literature and is able to generalize different characteristics of the movement (mobility range required, muscle activation, phase division, etc.) both in oral and written form.
