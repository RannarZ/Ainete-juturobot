The lab course will introduce laboratory methods and techniques from the fields of physics, chemistry, genetics, micro-, molecular and cell biology, gene technology, bioengineering and robotics.. Students will get both theoretical knowledge and practical experience in different methods like chemical titration, Western blot, PCR, Gel electrophoresis, DNA extraction, use microscope to determine bacteria, get hands-on experience in LEGO robot construction. Furthermore, students will learn how to write scientific report, analyze the obtained results, troubleshoot. Students will complete practical assignments and tests, write and submit reports.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this course is to give theoretical background and practical experience in the following areas of physics, chemistry, biology and robotics.
Students will become familiar with the following techniques:
1) Chemical titration
2) Western blot
3) PCR
4) Gel electrophoresis
5) DNA extraction
6) Plasmid purification
7) restriction analysis
8) preparation and negative staining of human oral microbiome to explore the morphology of different microbes inhabiting oral cavity; 
9) preparation and simple staining of a pure culture of one bacterial strain; 
10) determination of susceptibility/resistance of different bacteria to lyzosyme;
11) determination of the ability to use citrate and urea as carbon source by different bacteria;
12) Sub-culturing attached cell lines requiring trypsin; 
13) Thawing frozen cells; 
14) Fixing attached cells in paraformaldehyde
15) Investigation of random quantity distribution law using AC grid voltage
16) Determining the power and efficiency of a solar cell 
 
Students will improve their skills in:
1) writing scientific report
2) analyzing the results of the experiment
Students will learn to operate simple light microscope, construct  LEGO robot.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  By the end of the course students will be able to:
