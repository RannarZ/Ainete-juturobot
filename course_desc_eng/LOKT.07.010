The basic principles of chemistry will be coveredObjectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of the course is to help students develop "chemical insight" - the ability to see matter through chemists' eyes, and to make connections between chemical principles, theory, experimentation, and the world around us.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who has passed the course: * Can describe the electronic structure of the atoms and knows the relations between electronic structure and the properties of atoms * Knows different types of chemical bonding and can use this knowledge to predict the properties of substances * Can predict molecular shape using VSEPR and valence-bond theories * Knows the main properties of gases, liquids, and solids and relates them to the bonding * Knows the laws of thermodynamics and how to use them, also for describing of physical and chemical equilibria * Knows main acid-base theories and can calculate pH of simple solutions * Can balance redox equations and knows the basics of electrochemistry * Knows the basics of chemical kinetics and can use rate laws * Knows the most important inorganic compounds (incl. complexes), their nomenclature and reactions * Knows the most important organic compounds (incl. polymers, proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids), their nomenclature and reactions
