This lecture series provides systematic theoretical foundations of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.Objectives/eesm채rkid:  To cognize the principal differences between laws of quantum and classical mechanics, to get used to paradoxiality of the formers. To acquire fundamentals of conceptual and mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics on such level which gives a requisite literacy for dealing with courses and/or R&D fields based on quantum mechanics.Learning outcomes/천piv채ljund:  Upon completion of this course, the student  1) understands the particle-wave-duality and the basic postulates of quantum mechanics, 2) knows and is able to explain notions, equations, and relations (incl. uncertainty relations), effects, and paradoxes of quantum mechanics and its mathematical apparatus  -- all this within limits indicated by the program of the course, 3) is able to solve the Schr체dinger equation for the model problems given in the program and in the worksheets, also knows the ideas and methods of the perturbation theory, 4) knows and is able to apply the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics in the limits dtermined by the programm and the exercises in the worksheets, also is able to carry out derivation of formulas, incl those formulated as homework in the worksheets, 5) knows the conceptual and philosophical problems and issues of quantum mechanics, is able to discuss these themes and rebut false conclusions from "common sense"
