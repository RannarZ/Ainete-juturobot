Bioorganic chemistry is medicine-based course in which the following problems are highlighted: a) the principles of nomenclature and classification of organic compounds,especially drugs and metabolites; b) stereochemistry of drugs, metabolites and biomacromolecules and its biomedical importance; c) general types of chemical reactions and synthesis methods of organic compounds; d) structure and activity relationships of organic compounds (especially metabolites of human body and drugs), e) general types of metabolic reactions of human body and their biomedical importance.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Main objective of this course of Bioorganic chemistry for students of Department of Pharmacy is to master the knowledge about basic organic chemistry, nomenclature of organic compounds, their classification, and reactions of most important functional groups. The course is important for medically relevant knowledge about structure and physico-chemical properties of drugs, metabolites and other bioactive organic compounds and also about their synthesis and functionality. Course basic topics are helpful in further studies of Medical Biochemistry, Physiology, Pharmacology, etc.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who graduated the course: - has an overview of basic concepts of organic chemistry - knows classification of organic compounds - can name organic compounds by international nomenclature - knows basic concepts of stereochemistry - can orientate in basic terms of medical metabolomics and bioorganic chemistry, describe and discuss structural features needed for certain biofunctionality of drugs, metabolites and biomacromolecules.
