The lecture course provides an introduction to perturbation theory and its applications in gravitational physics. It covers the foundations of the perturbation theory of tensor fields, in particular the metric tensor, as well as several important formalisms used in gravity theory, such as: 1. the linearization of gravitational field equations and the speed of gravitational waves, 2. the Newman-Penrose formalism and the polarization of gravitational waves, 3. the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism and solar system tests of gravity, 4. cosmological perturbations and cosmological observables of gravity. Examples from (simple) gravity theories based on different geometric descriptions will be used during the course.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The objective of the lecture course is to provide an introduction to perturbation theory and different perturbative methods used, in particular, in the theoretical description of gravity.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course the student knows the foundations of perturbation theory and the most important perturbative formalisms in gravitational physics. He / she can perform perturbative calculations of tensor fields and apply these formalisms to different gravity theories.
