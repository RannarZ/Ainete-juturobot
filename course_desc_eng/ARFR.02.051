During this course, the goals of the course will be explained in the initial lecture. Pharmacological terminology, types of receptors and drug specificity will be explained. The mechanisms underlying pharmacokinetics, which is the action of the body on the drug, will be explained. Pharmacokinetics includes drug absorption, distribution, metabolism (biotransformation) and excretion (ADME). Mechanisms underlying pharmacodynamics, which is the action of the drug on the body, will be taught. Pharmacodynamics includes the action of the drug on the cell, the system and the body bearing in mind that the action of the drug will also be affected by its pharmacokinetic profile. Exemplar drugs will be used to teach the principles of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Principles guiding therapeutic drug use and the side-effects of the main groups of drugs will be explained. Dangerous side-effects of drugs, the general principles of cell damage and death, mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, teratogenicity and allergic reactions will be taught.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to provide basic knowledge on the main pharmacodynamic effects of drugs and groups of drugs. By the end of the course, the student will know how the primary pharmacodynamic effects of drugs are transformed into secondary pharmacodynamic effects and how drugs may be used in the treatment of diseases. The student will become familiar with pharmacokinetic properties of drugs and drug groups and how the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs determines their efficacy and toxicity. Students will become familiar with the side-effects and potential toxicities of the main groups of drugs, the mechanisms of their side-effects and principles to avoid these side-effects. The student will learn how to prescribe drugs according to the laws of the Estonian Republic.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students who have passed this course in basic Pharmacology will understand the basic principles of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and will have built up a base of knowledge on the mechanisms of actions of the most-used drugs, at the molecular and whole-organism level. Students will have learned about the most important groups of drugs and important representatives from each of these groups. For each of these representatives, the student will know the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, side-effects and the usefulness of the representative in treating particular pathologies. The student will have learned the mechanisms by which these representatives induce therapeutic effects and side effects and will have demonstrated knowledge on how to prevent or treat these side effects. The student will also have learned how to work with the scientific literature and will become capable of critically assessing published data in the field of pharmacology.
After passing the course the student knows the main groups of drugs and the main pharmacological effects and side-effects of drugs, belonging to these groups.
