Measure-theoretic basic probability course, where the fundamentals of modern probability and the most important results are covered. Among others, the following issues are treated rigorously: convergence of random variables, laws of large numbers, characteristic functions, central limit theorems, concentration inequalities, convergence of probability measures.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Basic measure-theoretic probability course that organically combines  several branches of stochastics. The course gives necessary theoretialc basis for the further studies in probability, statistics and financial mathematics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After taking the course, a student: 1. knows the fundamentals of Kolmogorov axiomathics; 2. knows the connections between measure-theory and probability; 3. knows the basic theorems of probability theory (Borel-Cantelli lemmas, laws of large number, 1-0 laws, concentration inequalities, central limit theorems etc); 4. can independently read probability textbooks; 5. knows the connections between probability theory and other branches of mathematics; 6. has enjoyed beautiful mathematics.
