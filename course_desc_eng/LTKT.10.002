The course gives basic understanding of structures and chemical properties of different biomolecules.   During the lectures, seminars and home work we try to  understand  chemical nature of several biological processes.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Introduction to chemisrty of biomolecules, metabolism and signal transduction. Elucidation links between chemistry and biology.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who passed the course successfully: *	knows general structure and chemical properties of main biopolymers and their monomers; *	knows chemical essence of some metabolic pathways   *	can explain some biological processes in chemical terms;
