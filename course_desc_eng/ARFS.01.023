The course with lectures, labs and seminars is focused on main issues of medical biophysics.Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course helps to understand the biophysical basis of functioning of the human body, describes the use of different measuring devices to assess functions of the organism and explains how to present the results in graphical form.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing this course the student should be able to:
- understand the language of equations, that means the ability to interpret the relationships in these equations,
- use basic experimental devices for measurements, 
- construct and read graphs with the results from the measurements
- describe basic concepts of mechanics, fluid physics, electricity, optics, thermodynamics and radiation physics, and connect those with principles of human physiology and diagnostic measurement devices.
