defence
Planning and writing the PhD thesis, writing research articles suitable for publication in international peer-reviewed journals and defending it on a public defense.

A doctoral defense is considered successful if all of the following conditions are met:
1. The choice of topic, the research problem, the scope of the task and the research questions: the information value of the topic must be significant.
2. The account of previous research: the study must be a purposeful continuation to an earlier discourse, or present a new approach to the topic. Thus earlier studies must be taken into account, but they should not be repeated.
3.
4. Clarity of terminology and argumentation: it must be clear to the reader what the research is about.
5. Methodology: the researcher must reflect on the chosen of approach and justify it.
6. Presentation of the results and conclusions: the importance of the results and conclusions must not be either over- or under-valued from the point of view of the advancement of science. The analysis must be logical and comprehensive.
7. Aspects of the form: the presentation must have a rational structure and be clearly written. The ideas must not be submerged in a flood of information.
8. Undogmatic approach: the researcher must be critical about earlier studies, theories, methods, empirical data, sources and the scientific value of his/her work. In other words, a good piece of research is original and independent.
9. At the defense procedure the researcher engages with the opinions of the oponent(s) and convincingly argues for the methods and conclusions of the thesis.Objectives/eesmärkid:  PhD students' research aims at acquiring the skills and technical competence necessary for conducting research. Research must lead to completion of independent study project proposing a reasoned original solution to a substantial problem in a particular research field, which presupposes the publication of at least three research papers in leading international journals of the speciality.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Doctoral candidates acquire the skills and techniques of conducting research in their speciality; are able to pose research problems important to their field and offer well-argued and original solutions to them; have the command of relevant methods of data collection and analysis; have advanced analytical and critical skills; have the skill of writing research articles suitable for publication in international peer-reviewed journals.
