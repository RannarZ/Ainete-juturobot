This course provides an overview of the process of academic writing in English (as a non-native language). It examines how writers (whether novice or expert) understand the requirements set by writing assignment within their discipline and respond to these assignment appropriately (supporting different writing tasks). As part of the academic language learning requirements, a part of the course will be dedicated to applying academic style in writing and presentations. It demonstrates how learning from reading academic text and listening to academic presentations within their discipline can help students to enhance their linguistic repertoire. To determine the disciplinary requirements, academic texts offered in other courses will be used and analysed as examples. As the course is about developing skills, students are required to write a text. The text will be developed by writing a series of drafts, which will be commented on by peers and teachers to support the development of writing as well as developing a better sense of audience in writing.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this course is to place more emphasis on the development of academic writing both from the perspective of writing organisation and processes as well as developing the English language skills needed to express knowledge in writing and in oral presentations. Added to this aim, this course also aims to teach the importance of academic rules and ethics as well as develop skills needed for learning in a multicultural classroom.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of the course, the students will be able to: 1) explain what makes academic writing academic; 2) identify the needs of writing assignments within their discipline; 3) efficiently and effectively organize their writing tasks; 4) understand and use appropriate grammatical tenses, style and sentence structure to express meaning in the academic writing; 5) apply different techniques to improve textual cohesion, formal and informal writing; 6) edit their text for wordiness; 7) apply simple tools to analyse their text for logic of argumentation; 8) practice the general requirements related to academic rules and ethics (needed to avoid academic plagiarism); 9) organize and prepare oral presentations; 10) adapt with learning in an multicultural classroom.
