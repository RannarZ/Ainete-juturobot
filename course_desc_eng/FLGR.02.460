The aim of the course is to explain the basic aspects of the heritage which comes from ancient Greek and Roman culture and find its expression in literature, language, art and in other fields of culture. The purpose is to give freshmen (first year students) a systematisized survey of the processes that have influenced the development of the European intellectual and spiritual atmosphere through centuries. The approach is casual and comparative, the elements of the study include mythology, religion, art, law system and various literary genres (epics, rhetoric, drama, prose). The surwey is focused on the most important features that have influenced also Estonian culture (language and literature). Next to the literary legacy the attention is payed to other fields in social life, e.g. sport, teatre etc. The introductory knowledge in humanities will be obtained that leads to the sources of the cultural development in Western Europe (proceeding from the ancient Greek and Roman heritage). The material introduced during the course will widen philological and cultural competence and can be combined later with the knowledge in special courses.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to explain the basic aspects of the heritage which comes from ancient Greek and Roman culture and find its expression in literature, language, art and in other fields of culture.
