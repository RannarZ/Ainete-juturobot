We analyse series of important theoretical concepts as used by the participants in their semiotic research. We study how to use the concepts from different theories in the framework of one model. We examine concepts as tools in semiotic inquiry that are decisive for the organisation and shaping of the semiotic research object. The subject consists of lectures delivered by specialists of diverse directions in the paradigm of semiotics. In the frame of the course students make presentations about selected notions that are central for their own doctoral thesis.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to help doctoral students in using and applying theoretical concepts in their work.  Analysis of concepts in contemporary semiotic theory. Description of the historical background of the central notions of the contemporary semiotics. We view general terminology and conceptions, the applicability and usage in specific subsections of semiotics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  We acquire skills of using theoretical concepts (both intrasemiotic and extrasemiotic) in a practical research. The student is able to orientate in the paradigm of the semiotic vocabulary and terminology, and to associate it with disciplines next to semiotics both historically and contemporarily. The student is able to map semiotics in the territory of other social sciences and humanities.
