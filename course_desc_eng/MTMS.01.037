Non-parametric distribution estimation and basic properties of order statistics are examined. Major part of the course is dedicated 
to the distribution-free hypothesis testing, main attention is paid to the estimation of location characteristics. 
All the material is covered by exercises.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to give students an overview of nonparametric statistical methods - rank tests, large sample theory, efficiecy comparisons etc.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Participants who pass this course
- know main properties of order statistics;
- know frequently used nonparametric tests;
- can test the most often postulated hypothesis even if the distribution of variable of interest is unknown;
- can calcuate the (asymptotic) power for the most frequently used nonparametric tests.
