The course introduces the basic notions and typical research questions of digital humanitties as well as the methods and tools to solve them.
The course is taught by visiting lecturers of digital humanitites. The content of the course varies, depending on the lecturer.

The course for fall semester 2020/2021 and also for the fall semester 2021/2022 provides an overview of ways in which humanities scholars can use their computers to work with their data that go beyond simply word processing. We will look at a wide range of topics in order to provide a general introduction into what is possible and to expose students to these topics, so that they can then focus on those aspects relevant to their own research later on. 

The course is supported by the (European Union) European Regional Development Fund (University of Tartu ASTRA project PER ASPERA).
Technological advances in computational methods should be accessible to humanities researchers, not only to the hard sciences and tech start-ups.

On 2018/2019 spring semester the course mainly focused on text mining and analysis techniques with the statistical package R.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal is to introduce the field of digital humanities, its research questions, methods and tools.
