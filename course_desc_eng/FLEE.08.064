This course is concerned with the field of psycholinguisics, which investigates the connections between language and psychological processes. Various subdomains of psycholinguistics are introduced, including first and second language acquisition, language processing (both production and comprehension) on various linguistic levels, multilingualism and language disorders. We discuss the research methods and concepts employed by psycholinguists as well as key results in the field. In-person meetings combine lectures and discussion; the group work and the essay writing process help develop skills in academic expression.Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course aims to give an overview of psycholinguistics and its main research methods.
