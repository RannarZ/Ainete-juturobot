The course is aimed at anyone who has no prior exposure to geoinformatics and geoinformatics software. The course is Moodle-based and is divided into topics that the student goes through independently. The topics consist of a theoretical and a practical part and end with a test and a practical exercise. Detailed guidelines have been developed to deal with the latter. During the course there will be 1 lecture  via web, which will briefly introduce the topics and and 1 seminar (again via web), which will  discuss the issues arising in independent work.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to introduce the basics of geoinformatics through QGIS freeware.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion, the student * can use basic QGIS capabilities * understands how QGIS works * is able to edit vector data * can use different coordinate systems * can perform spatial analysis with raster or vector data in QGIS  * can design maps in QGIS
