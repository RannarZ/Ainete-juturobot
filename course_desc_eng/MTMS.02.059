In theory of probability are considered random event and his classical probability;
random variable and  probability distribution.
In the part of mathematical statistics on bases of samples the estimations of characteristics of population (point and interval estimators) and testing of hypothesis are treated.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is   *	to provide knowledge of the methods of theory of probability and mathematical statistics; *	to provide skills to use the methods in solving professional problems.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Passing through the module, a participant
*	understands the concept of the random event and the ruls to calculate his probability;
*	acquires basic principles for probabilistic characterization of random variables; 
*	knows the most popular theoretical distributions (binomial, Poisson, normal and Student ) and is able to applay them;
*	knows the main rules of estimating the population characteristics on bases of samples (point estimators, interval estimators, put and test hypothesis);
*	knows and understands the essence of studed methods and is able to apply them in solving practical problems;
