The purpose of the course is to introduce future chemistry teachers ways to make chemistry lessons more attractive, for example using virtual reality, the idea of flipped classroom, escape rooms and etc. The university students go through the seminar materials by themselves in the form of practical work. In the end of the course each university student prepares a topic set which can later be used to conduct a practicum in a general education school.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To introduce different opportunities for making a chemistry lesson more attractive. To give an overview of the experiments in school chemistry that can be performed with supplies obtained from ordinary trade.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student, who has completed the course 1. acknowledges the importance of performing experiments as well as using alternative theoretical materials besides a text book to teach chemistry in a general education school, 2. knows how to use chemicals and test equipment safely while performing an experiment and is able to evaluate the time span and economical aspect of performable experiments, 3. is able to use their knowledge to solve school chemistry problems and can compose corresponding practical exercises for students, 4. is able to associate the problems in school chemistry with everyday life and other scientific problems.
