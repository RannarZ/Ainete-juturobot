defence
Independent work with literature in the speciality, collecting and analysing data, formulating a research question, choosing methods appropriate for solving it, analysis of results, and formulating the results in accordance with the requirements set at the University of Tartu. The PhD dissertation may be written in two formats: monograph (the student has to write at least one peer-reviewed research article to be allowed to the defense) and an article dissertation where previously published research articles are introduced by a comprehensive introductory article (the student has to write at least three peer-reviewed research articles to be allowed to the defense. The dissertation is assessed in two stages: pre-review and public defence. The pre-reviewers present their clearly argued opinion that states whether the dissertation is to be allowed to the public defense or that it needs additional work. By approving a dissertation for defense, the council confirms that the dissertation meets the requirements set and that it deserves a PhD degree in the case of a successful defence. The defence, however, may still result in a failure if unexpected grave problems are detected either in the dissertation or in the oral defence of the PhD candidate. The opponent for the final defence presents their written review that assesses the quality of the paper. The PhD candidate responds to the questions in a public debate with the opponent and responds to possible additional questions from the members of the council and other people present. In the case of a successful defence the dissertation is considered defended. If the work is discovered to contain plagiarism, the dissertation will have to be assessed by experts and no decision will be made. If unexpected grave problems not discovered in the pre-review come to light in the dissertation or the defence, the dissertation will be considered undefended.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the PhD thesis is the preparation of an independent research paper that presents a substantiated original solution to an essential problem in a specific research area.
