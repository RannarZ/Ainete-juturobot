The course aims to enlighten the importance of using information and communications technologies in transport through ITS. The course will introduce the basic concepts and principles of systems integration and technology implementation applied to intelligent transportation systems. Moreover, the course will cover the key technologies in sensing, communication, and data management and techniques for system evaluation, including automatic vehicle location and identification, dynamic control systems, travel information systems, and incident detection systems. In addition, the course gives an overview of ITS products and services as well as economic, social, and environmental issues in ITS implementation.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  At the completion of this course the students will be able to:
*demonstrate a clear understanding of the role of ITS and where technology solutions have succeeded and failed.
*demonstrate critical thinking in evaluating the range of technologies implemented in ITS applications.
*develop the ability to assess how technology solutions can be used to solve transportation issues or problems
*develop the ability to evaluate the social and environmental impact of the use of new technologies in ITS.
*plan, design and manage the implementation of an ITS project
*explore ITS applications at world wild level.
