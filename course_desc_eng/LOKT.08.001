Theoretical chemistry is a discipline that deals with the theoretical and computational characterization of the properties of chemical compounds at both the atomic and molecular levels, using both physics models and data-driven approaches. The field includes the (i) basics of quantum mechanics, (ii) quantum mechanics of atoms, (iii) quantum mechanics of molecules, (iv) molecular mechanics, (v) molecular dynamics, (vi) cheminformatics, (vii) theoretical description of the properties of chemical compounds, etc.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the study subject is to convey the basics of theoretical chemistry and to provide and consolidate user experience through practical experience at computer laboratory.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon passing this studysubject, the student: - knows the fields of theoretical chemistry - knows their theoretical basis - can describe atoms and molecules - can present the structure of a molecule digitally - can describe the properties of chemical compounds by methods of theoretical chemistry - has experience in practical work with the methods of theoretical chemistry at the level of seminar work. Within the framework of transferable competencies, the student is able to: - work with Windows and/or UNIX (Linux) operating systems, - is able to prepare protocols of calculation works, - has an in-depth knowledge of Estonian professional terminology, etc.
