The practical course will give hands on experience for:
the estimation of compounds (photosynthetic pigments) and activities of enzymes (nitrate  reductase, water photooxidation complex) characteristic for plants; 
measurement of the photosynthetic electron transport rate and water metabolism parameters; 
the measurement of plant cells and organelles. (10 practical works)Objectives/eesmärkid:  Taking the course, students will gain insight into basic experimental approaches and use of equipment to measure the main metabolic processes of plants, plant specific compounds and enzymes.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  1. To be able to use UV-microscopy, spectrophotometry, refractrometere, porometer, centrifuges, and other apparata used by plant physiologist in laboratory applications.  2. To be able to measure enzyme and calculate activities (nitrateredcutase, water photooxydation). 3. To be able to generate correctly formatted reports (incl. calculations and figures).
