Teaching practice for those training to become secondary school teachers of English. During the traineeship (5-7 weeks in duration), students acquaint themselves with the groups and then teach up to 10 classes to lower-secondary students and up to 10 classes to upper-secondary students, both under the supervision of a qualified teacher. In seminars, lessons taught and teaching problems encountered are discussed. On the conclusion of the traineeship, each student writes a self-assessment report and presents a teaching portfolio.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course has three main objectives that should be achieved with the help of the other courses of the MA programme, including the continuous pedagogical trainee practice: 1) to support the development of the student's teaching skills by creating the opportunities for associating the knowledge and skills obtained throughout the MA programme with practical teacher's work in an educational institution; 2) to create opportunities to explore the educational process as a whole and to teach during a complete educational period; 3) to give an opportunity to apply the principles of EFL methodology.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  By the end of trainee practice students 1) are able to plan, implement, analyze and evaluate their activities related to education in general and EFL teaching in particular; 2) are able to plan the teaching process, to teach and to support learners, taking into account the learners' individual characteristics, prior knowledge, needs (including educational needs) and interests; 3) design the teaching process systematically and creatively, taking into account the major state regulations and considering the distinctive characteristics of the school, grade and the subject as well as the needs and interests of students; 4) integrate successfully the knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired during the studies at the university.
