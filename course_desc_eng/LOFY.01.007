The course begins with the brief introduction into the basics of electromagnetic phenomena. The discussion on the direct and alternating currents, the electrostatics, magnetostatics and dynamic electromagnetic field follows. Next, the following topics are in the main focus of attention of the given course: the polarization and magnetization of the matter and finally the specific electromagnetic materials and devices.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main goal of the course is to give the systematic overview considering the description of electromagnetic phenomena using four field vectors (E, D, B, H). This overview is based on the methods of mathematical physics. The static electric, magnetic and dynamic electromagnetic fields, as well as their interaction with the matter are considered. Finally, the most important applications of electromagnetic phenomena in physics and technology are introduced.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to: 1. Possess the knowledge considering the vocabulary and definitions necessary for the characterization of electromagnetic field in vacuum as well as in matter (i.e., vectors E, D, P, B, H and M, their functions and mutual relationships, potentials of the electric and magnetic field, the permeabilities and susceptibilities of the matter); 2. Describe the electric or magnetic field (with the aid of field lines) generated by field sources possessing up to three dimensions and different geometry (i.e., point, straight line, round, plane, sphere), and characterize the dependence of field vectors (E or B) on the system parameters; 3.  Formulate the Maxwell equations in their integral or differential form and explain the corresponding mathematical representations (e.g., the linear, surface and volume densities of quantities, linear and surface integrals, gradient, flux, divergence, circulation, curl), as well as correlate the Maxwell equations with the certain electromagnetic phenomena; 4. Calculate the current values in the different parts of AC and DC circuits, the voltage values on the certain components of these circuits and the power values generated in those components; draw the phasors of the AC circuits with the given parameters; 5. Explain the functioning principles of the widely applied electromagnetic materials (metals, dielectrics, piezoelectrics, ferromagnetics, electrolytes, semiconductors, superconductors, gas discharge plasma) and devices (capacitor, inductive coil, electromagnet, resonance circuit, transformer, electric motor, generator, thermocouple, piezoelectric sensors and actuators, Hall sensor, mass spectrometer, electro-optical lens, semiconducting devices, magnetic memory devices); 6. Solve the problems considering the electromagnetic phenomena (within the level of examples presented during the seminars).
