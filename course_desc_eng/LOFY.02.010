The course gives an overview of basic technologies used for fabrication and processing of different materials (metals, ceramics, plastics, composites, electronic materials). The relationships between the structure, physical properties and processing of the materials are treated. The emphasis is on advanced materials and their technologies, including e.g. key materials used in information technologies, sensor devices, and new energy sources. Introduction is given to crystal growth and thin film techniques, to laser growth and processing of the materials, as well as to emerging nanotechnologies.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to give an overview of basic and emerging materials technologies in conjunction with underlying physical principles.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of the course, the students: 1.  Are able to classify the technological materials, know their basic properties and fields of application. 2. Possess the knowledge of basic technologies for preparation and processing of structural materials. 3. Have an overview of basic technologies of functional (electronic, photonic, etc) materials and microchips. 4. Are able to associate the material properties with technology (or justify why a given type of material is produced with precisely this sort of technology and not by another type).   5. Are able to describe the physical processes occurring in the materials during technological treatments and apply the respective physical models in solving the problems.
