The aim of this course is to provide a qualitative description of most important quantum mechanical processes. A student gains an experience to solve simple problems in atomic and nuclear physics.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of the course is to introduce the most important differences between macroscopic and microscopic physical systems (Planck constant, quantum numbers, selection rules, spin of the particle etc). An overview of the ways to describe the physical features of atoms, nuclei and elementary particles will be given. The main experimental methods used to obtain the information about these objects are also discussed.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of this course, the student is expected to: 1. be able to describe quantitatively the modern quantum-mechanical models of the atom and the nucleus; be able to describe the nuclear reactions and the conversions between the elementary particles;  2. be able to characterize the stationary states of atoms, nuclei and elementary particles and also the conversion processes between the states using quantum numbers and selection rules; 3. outline the most important experimental methods used in atomic, nuclear and particle physics; 4. be able to solve the physical problems on the difficulty level defined by the homeworks used in the subject.
