This course teaches the critical skills of data engineering, i.e., data modeling, collection, transformation, and wrangling. The course discusses the role of data engineers in the data science/AI life-cycle. It shows (i) how to gather data from various sources (databases, repositories, web services, and even websites); (ii) how to design data pipelines to perform data transformations and how to scale them up; (iii) how to clean, enhance, and augment data to feed data science pipelines.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main objective of the course is to gain practical skills for collecting, cleaning, transforming, and organizing data, following various data models. The course covers the most common data formats, models, and technologies.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing this course, the student can:
* Collect data from heterogeneous data sources, such as from websites, social media, web services, SQL and NoSQL databases, structured, JSON and plain text file formats;
* Design models for the data using various techniques, e.g.,  as ER diagrams from relational data, property graphs for graph data, and star/snowflake schemas.
* Design data pipelines to transform data into desired forms and perform data integration;
* Describe the advantages and limitations of various data storage and processing technologies based on the given requirements (e.g., batch processing, real-time processing);
* Assess and measure the data by quality and volume;
* Clean the data by detecting and dealing with issues such as duplicates and missing values;
