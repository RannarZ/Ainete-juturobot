The ethics of animal research is one of the cornerstones of natural and medical sciences, and without this knowledge, the education received in the university remains incomplete. This statement is not an exaggeration and animal research ethics is one of those critical topics that almost every person involved in natural or medical sciences comes into contact in his professional work. There are different ethical positions about the methods used in animal research and a student should know these in order to make a well-considered decision whether to use methods for animal studies that require animal killing (still a rather common practice) or to choose methods that do not require such cruelty. This is crucial. During the course, the core issues in animal research ethics and various methods that allow animal studies to be carried out without killing animals are introduced. The number of such methods has grown considerably in recent years and can replace many old-fashioned cruel methods. Based on the knowledge gained from the course, each student can formulate his or her own position and make a choice, which methods to use. Thus, the course on animal research provides the necessary background knowledge on which the student can make a well-considered decision.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course provides an overview of the different problems in the field of animal research ethics. Also, new non-lethal methods of animal research will be introduced, as well as the current legislation of European Union. Seminars include presentations that are based on term papers, followed by discussion that address the controversy and contradictions of different approaches in animal studies. The course is well suited also for the students of medical faculty, as it addresses problems of animal research in the field of biomedicine and provides examples of alternative methods, the transition to which seems critical if the aim is to develop new therapies to protect human health as effectively and safely as possible.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student who has completed the course: 1) has acquired basic knowledge of animal research ethics; 2) knows a variety of methods that allow for animal studies to be carried out without the killing of animals, i.e. using alternative approaches; 3) can formulate an opinion on the methods used in animal research, can critically evaluate different methods and is open to novel approaches
