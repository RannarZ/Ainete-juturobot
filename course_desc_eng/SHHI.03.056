"Neurocognitive aspects of learning" is a course focusing on affective and cognitive processes such as perception, language, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion /motivation within nervous systems from neural circuitry to brain organization. It provides neuroscience's current understanding of information processing gained largely from both human and animal research. The relevance of these findings and concepts to understanding human behavior will be discussed. Different types of learning and multiple memory systems will be compared and contrasted, some of the molecular mechanism thought to underlie these processes will be discussed. We will also discuss how disruptions to these mechanisms or specific brain regions can result in perception, learning and memory deficits. Students will be encouraged to use their knowledge in teaching and improving their own learning.Objectives/eesmärkid:  - to explain the organization and action of the nervous system sufficient for comprehensive understanding of neural basis of cognitive functions.  - to give an overview of molecular, cellular and system level approaches of information processing, learning and memory. - to explain cognitive, affective and motor aspects of learning in context of special educational needs.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  By the end of the course, the student will:
1. Describes the role of nervous system on cognitive and affective functions, learning and memory.
2. Describes and differentiates the various types of learning, memory and attention, and the brain regions that underlie these different processes.
3. Understands how research in the field of affective and cognitve functions is performed.
4. Evaluates his/her own learning and understands how to improve learning, attention and memory in different settings.
