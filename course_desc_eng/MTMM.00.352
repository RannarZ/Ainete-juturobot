Mathematics is handled and viewed as a separate subject in the Estonian national curriculum and as a subject integrated to other natural science lessons. Topics covered (e.g. logarithms, models related to percent increase, probability, etc) support the understanding of models in natural sciences. Mathematical knowledge and skills are inegrated into science expectations. Problem solving strategies are introduced. Geogebra, graphs, real plane, trigonometry, systems of equations, average and dispersions will be reviewed.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Goal of the course is to give the participants an overview of mathematics topics at school.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student who has passed this course: * knows and is capable of naming the regulations of mathematics according to the national curricula; * knows and is able to describe the content of mathematics taught at school; * is able to solve the tasks mentioned in the content of the subject * is capable of doing reasonable choice to study becoming mathematics teacher.
