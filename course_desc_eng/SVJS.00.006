This course aims to introduce issues, themes, and scope of the CEERES programme, to assist students in developing a targeted dissertation proposal. Two interconnected aims hence sit at the core of this course. On the one hand, the course intends to introduce the history, the politics, and key socio-economic developments across the region in question, namely Central, Eastern Europe and Eurasia, including Russia. On the other, the course aims to familiarise students with key concepts of the core disciplinary strands that underpin the CEERES programme. These two main topics divide the course also into two parts. In the first part, students work independently through e-learning materials that introduce either historical or contemporary developments in CEERE regions. After that, they create a digital presentation as a collective product where they analyse and compare particular developments in these regions. Those presentations get feedback in the weekly seminars. In the second half of the course, students work through independently video lectures that introduce the main Social Science concepts and theories. Based on those materials, students propose research puzzles that will be discussed in weekly seminars. The course ends with an oral examination where students demonstrate their knowledge of the main historical and contemporary developments in CEERE regions and their analytical skills. The final work of the course is students' research proposal of their MA theses that defines their 3rd-semester mobility.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course aims to create a general understanding of the main historical and contemporary developments in CEERE regions and introduce various disciplines in Social Sciences that enable scrutinising those developments. Thereby students have instruments to elaborate a research proposal for their dissertation.  To achieve this general aim, the course develops various essential skills to graduate from the CEERES curriculum. Among them, the most crucial skills are: - comparative analysis to compare and contrast various regions of the CEERES curriculum; - synthesising to interpret and reflect the historical and contemporary social developments in CEERE regions; - defining a research puzzle to develop a research proposal independently; - peer-learning and constructive feedbacking to support independent learning; - creating academically rigorous digital joint production to enhance peer-learning skills; - cooperation skills of the study group to create and enhance the study cohort's identity.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to: - Critically analyse the history, the politics, and the socio-economic landscapes of Central and Eastern Europe, Eurasia, and Russia; - Make coherent connections between historical processes and contemporary socio-political developments, including the international relations of the region in question; - Understand and discuss key concepts of Political Science, International Relations, Sociology, Anthropology, Cultural Studies relevant to the study of the CEERES region; - Apply these concepts to elaborate a coherent analysis of the programme's focus region; - Develop an independent research proposal related to one of the programme's core disciplinary fields with specific focus on one of the geographical constituents of CEERES's focus region.
