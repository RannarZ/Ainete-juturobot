This practical course enables students to understand the importance of communication in the workplace and as applied to the management of people. Through communication model analysis, students get to know the essence of communication, its goals and driving factors. Explained constructs and approaches are practically applied in three ways: (1) in-class practical exercises (e.g., business meeting simulation); (2) between-class written assignments (e.g., preparing a resume with a motivation letter); (3) in-class speaking assignments with between-class preparation (e.g., delivering speeches). Many of the tasks of this course call for students` cooperation and promote joint activities. To put the learned constructs and skills in context, two speakers from relevant companies operating in Estonia will be invited to talk about the application of communications to real-life business situations and share their experience with different communication formats and approaches.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To introduce the basic principles and influencing factors of efficient communication on individual and organisational level and increase coping skills in the successful management of the communication process.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student who has successfully passed this subject:  *	has gained knowledge of the communication process and the factors that affect it,  *	is acquainted with different ways and techniques of communication,  *	is able to see choices in usage of communication techniques,  *	can analyze the mechanisms of organizational communication,  *	has solved cases to do with organizational communication, *	knows the possibilities to achieve the general and concrete objectives of an effective speech,  *	knows the structure of a speech, can prepare a speech and present it efficiently,  *	can respectfully analyze the wordings of co-students' ideas; *	can write and design CV, motivation letter, and simple forms of business letters, *	is ready to communicate efficiently.
