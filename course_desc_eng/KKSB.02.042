The main areas covered by the course are: 1) the effects of exercise on body functions at the level of cell, tissue, organ, organ system and organism as a whole; 2) physiological mechanisms of long-term adaptation to training; 3) physiological aspects of the specificity of training process in different sports; 4) the impact of environmental factors on physical performance capacity and efficacy of training.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to provide the students with systematic understanding of the functioning of human body during acute exercise and that of the physiological mechanisms of long-term adptations to prolonged training programs.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who has completed the course understands:
- skeletal muscle energy metabolism at rest and during exercise depending on the intensity and duration of exercise  
- the impact of acute exercise on different physiological functions depending on the intensity and duration of exercise
- basic physiological mechanisms of fatigue
- the basic physiological mechanisms of adaptation to chronic training loads with different orientation,
- the impact of nutritional factors on acute exercise performance and on the outcomes of prolonged training programs
- age-dependent aspects of exercise and training
- the impact of environmental factors and that of acclimation/acclimatization physical performance
- the relationships between nutrition, physical activity, bodyweight and body composition,

and is able to evaluate:
- the impact of different acute training loads on human body on the basis of physiological responses to these 
  loads
- the adequacy of planned exercise interventions with different purposes (recreation, rehabilitation, promotion of general 
  health, improving physical performance, improving athletic performance)     
- the expediency and nature of using nutritional interventions for improving the efficacy of planned exercise interventions  
  depending on the goals of these interventions
- the conformity of the planned training programs to the person's age, state of health and physical ability
