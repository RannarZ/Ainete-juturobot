The course includes a systematic overview of the physical research problems involving detailed examination of the concepts of physics related to the research topics of the PhD student ranging from the common basic to specific advanced level. The course is conducted via the individual work of a PhD student (total amount of approximately 2000 pages or 468 working hours). The course consists of three parts (6 ECTS each): 1) overview of the physics as a whole on the doctoral level (textbook Understanding Physics by Mansfield and O'Sullivan); 2) and 3) narrow research topics of each PhD student.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course aims to augment the knowledge of students considering the fundamental principles of the contemporary physics and the general methodology of the physics science, and to give overview about the most important and newest finding in the field.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The PhD student who passed the course successfully: - has wide knowledge and systematic overview in the field of physics; - has detailed and up-to-date knowledge in the branch where he/she is specialized in.
