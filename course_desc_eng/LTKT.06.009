Practical classes in analytical chemistry. The focus is on giving the students practical experience on using different labware and on simple chemical analysis methods: gravimetry, different titration methods,simple instrumental analysis methods  and sample preparation. Metrological aspects (calibration, measurement uncertainty, etc) of analytical chemistry also are involved.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Supporting the theoretical knowledge studied in lecture with practical aspects. To give the students basic practical knowledge about the most common chemical analysis methods and the basic skills to carry out chemical analyses (both manual work and data treatment). Oral self-expression skills are improved.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student knows: *	the principles and applications of gravimetric, potentiometric and titrimetric analysis; *	the basics of sample preparation in chemical analysis; *	the principles of the simple instrumental analysis. Student is able to  *	correctly use the basic analytical chemistry labware (pipettes, volumetric flasks, burettes, balances, magnetic stirrers, heating equipment etc); *	perform weighing and preparing solutions correctly; *	carry out basic sample preparation for analysis *	carry out chemical analysis, prepare appropriate report and calculate results for gravimetric, titrimetric and simple instrumental analysis.
