The course helps students to integrate the knowledge and skills gained in different methodology courses and, thus, prepares them for their teaching practice. Students analyse video-recorded  lessons from the point of view of both the teacher and the students and discuss different ways of sequencing activities in lessons. Each student prepares and teaches a 20-25-minute sequence of activities, followed by an immediate critique of their performance. All these mini lessons are video-recorded and students write an analysis of the lesson they taught.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main goal of the course is to support a student in becoming a teachers, creating opportunities to practice the acquirable from subject-didactics courses in the university before starting  practices in the environment of the educational institution.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  On successful completion of the course, students  - are familiar with different ways of sequencing activities in lessons, - applies the knowledge and skills gained in methodology classes to planning, teaching and analysing lessons, - creates a constructive classroom environment, supportive of learners and learning, - analyses classes taught by themselves and others bearing in mind the needs of a particular group of learners.
