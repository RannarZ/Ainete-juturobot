The basics of practical work in analytical chemistry are introduced: weighing, handling of pipettes, burettes, volumetric flasks, working with concentrated acids and bases, etc. The methods involved are: sample preparation, titrimetry (acid-base, complex-formation, redox), potentiometry, gas chromatography, Flame photometry, UV-Vis photometry. Groupwork in laboratory: 4 works are performed as groupworks. Using the spreadsheet program (MS Excel) purposefully for chemical measurements data analysis (principles, different functions, linear regression and charts).Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give the students practical knowledge about the most common chemical analysis methods and the basic skills to carry out chemical analyses (both manual work and data treatment). Oral self-expression skills are improved.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After this practical course the student:
-    knows the principles and applications of titrimetric, potentiometric, photometric, chromatographic and AES analysis;
-    is able to correctly use the basic analytical chemistry instruments and labware (pipettes, volumetric flasks, burettes, balances, magnetic stirrers, heating equipment);
-    can perform weighing and preparing solutions correctly;
-    knows the basics of sample preparation in chemical analysis;
-    knows the concept of selectivity and the main ways of achieving it (separation, masking);
-    can carry out basic sample preparation for analysis, perform common analytical determinations, evaluates the obtained data critically and calculates the analysis result using a spreadsheet program (e.g. MS Excel)
