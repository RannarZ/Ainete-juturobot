The course is divided into four thematic blocks. Each block will cover one specific topic.
Block 1 - AI in society. Digital literacy entails the ability to navigate a world influenced by AI methods and tools, where various activities are mediated by AI, affecting information search, interactions, decision-making, etc. In this Block we are going to be addressing three main issues: What is AI? What activities do AI tools and techniques affect in your life? What lies behind AI tools and techniques?  
Block 2 - Information search&evaluation. In this block you are invited to search for information on the scenarios that will be shared with you closer the time. Within your groups, you will be asked to describe how you searched for information and whether you encountered any difficulties or controversies while doing your information search.
Block 3 - Digital literacy (DL) in the postdigital era. We will explore the concept of postdigital which suggests that digital technology has become so integrated into our lives that it's no longer a distinct or separate concept, but rather an integral part of our everyday experiences. The focus will be on three main topics: critical DL (which is also tied in with information search in the previous block), holistic approach to DL that looks at the cultural, societal and ethical aspects of DL, and digital wellbeing.
