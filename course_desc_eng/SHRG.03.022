The course will have three parts: an introduction to core components of social science methodology, an examination of approaches to research design and case selection, and the application of methodological analysis to specific research works. It will also feature the pedagogical approach of a flipped classroom, in which in-class assignments and group work will figure prominently.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The objective of the course is to provide students a foundation in social science methodology that will serve as a basis for their studies in the rest of the program and for completing the MA thesis.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of the course, students will:  1) understand the main tenets of social science methodology as well as the sequence structure of methodological research;  2) understand essential epistemological perspectives on social science as well as formulate their own opinion concerning these issues;  3) understand and apply the fundamentals of social science research design (large-N, comparative method, single case study);  4) be capable of identifying and maturely evaluating the methodological approaches of other scholarly works;  5) begin the process of applying the same methodological rigor to one's own work, particularly with a view to the final MA thesis.
