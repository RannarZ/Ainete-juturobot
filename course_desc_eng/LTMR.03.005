The lecture course deals with the molecular mechanisms and regulation of biological processes in the bacterial cell. Mechanisms of physiological and genetic adaptation of bacteria in response to environmental stress are discussed. Examples of how to apply this knowledge in biotechnology, medicine, environmental protection, food microbiology and agriculture are explained and presented.

The following topics of biological processes are discussed: gene regulation at transcriptional and posttranscriptional level; translation regulation; posttranslational modification of proteins and secretion of proteins; global gene regulation and sensing environment signals; regulation of metabolism and energy generation; transport systems; adaptation of bacteria to different environmental stresses; differentiation of bacterial cells (biofilms, sporulation); phenotypic variation in bacterial populations; intra-species and inter-species communication in bacterial populations; bacterial interactions with the eukaryotic host; control of DNA replication initiation and cell division; tolerance and repair of DNA damage; bacterial evolution under stress conditions.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the lecture course is to provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms of biological processes in prokaryotic cells and the use of this knowledge in applied microbiology.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course, the students are expected: To acquire knowledge in molecular mechanisms of biological processes and their interconnections in bacterial cells. To be able to understand molecular mechanisms of physiological adaptation of bacteria to environmental conditions.  To know how to apply this knowledge in biotechnology, medicine, environmental protection, food microbiology and agriculture  To be able to use the acquired knowledge and skills in other disciplines in biology and in scientific research and find new solutions in applied microbiology.
