The course offers an introduction to problems that translators (and editors) encounter in their practice, and to methods of finding solutions. Practical exercises help understand the specificities of different texts (fiction, theatre and essays) and the considerations that shape a translator's work (context, target audience, poetics, linguistic norms etc., achieving adequate solutions both on the level of detail and of the whole text). Exercises include work with existing translations (knowledge of source language is not required) and translating texts. The source language for collective work is English, for individual work other source languages can be agreed upon.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give practical directions for translating literature and essays.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student is able to describe a text in terms of translation properties, to evaluate the quality of a translation with sound justification, and has personal experience of translating texts from fiction, drama or essay genre.
