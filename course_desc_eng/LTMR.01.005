The course covers the following topics: general structure of eukaryotic (human) and prokaryotic genome and methods of its investigation, types of mutations, how mutations occur and what type of mutation is behind a disease. In addition, the epigenome, methods of its study, and the relationship of epigenome changes to diseases are looked at more closely. The next level is the method of transcriptome, its regulation as well as the relationship of transcriptome changes to diseases. Further, the methods of proteome and its research and the relationship of changes in protein levels to diseases are already being considered. Special attention has also been paid to the microbial genome, its research and its relation to health. Metabolomics science, its methods and applications summarize the separate levels of biological information. In addition to familiarizing with the basics of "omics", the applied aspects of studying these layers of biological information, such as genome editing, gene-environment and gene-gene interactions, as well as cancer, reproductive and pharmacogenomics, with practical examples, are also discussed.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To provide students with a basis for understanding the different layers and levels of biological information. The topic that crosses the subject course is "why a person gets sick?" More specifically, what are normal values and deviations for a biological information and what changes can occur in the human body as a result.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student understands the different levels of biological information and understands the methods used to study them and the basics of analyzing the results obtained
