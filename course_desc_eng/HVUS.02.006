This course was created out of practical necessity. Given that most of the students defend their BA theses in the spring semester the previous fall semester is a perfect time to think through one's research plan. When it comes to coming up with a good thesis, it is of utmost importance that the selected topic be seamlessly integrated with an operational methodology. Also, it is important to know how to find relevant data from various sources open to the university. The course is specifically designed to assist students in building up this know-how.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Orienting bachelor level students in religious studies and/or theology as to the potential methods and databases for their bachelor's project.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The course qualifies the participant to: 1) Orient him- or herself as to the methodological bases of scientific research; 2) Come up with a realistic topic for a BA project and define the relevant variables; 3) Choose an appropriate methodological strategy from the viewpoint of the topic; 4) Use the scientific databases open to the university to cover the research project with data
