At the beginning of the course the science of genetics and basic features of cellular reproduction will be introduced. The next part of the course deals with concepts of classical genetics such as the basic principles of inheritance, extensions of Mendelism, it's chromosomal basis, variation in chromosome number and structure, and linkage, crossing over and chromosome mapping in eukaryotes, the concept of quantitative genetics. Additionally, basic molecular mechanisms of maintenance and realization of genetic information will be introduced. Basic techniques of molecular genetics,  regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and applications of molecular genetics. The course also briefly introduces human genetics, inheritance of complex traits, behavioural genetics. Finally, the concepts of population and evolutionary genetics are introduced.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main goal is to introduce the students to the main concepts and processes of genetics, to develop key principles of classical genetics and core concepts of molecular genetics. The course covers some aspects of human genetics, genomics, the inheritance of complex traits as well as population genetics and evolutionary genetics. In lectures, thematic problems and tasks will be solved.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course, the students are expected to * Understand, know and apply the core principles of Classical Genetics; * Understand the principles and processes of Molecular Genetics, incl. the processes of synthesis of genetic material, distribution and placement in the cells, expression of genetic material; * Knowledgeably use the terminology of genetics, incl. with the help of explanatory dictionaries; * Use the acquired knowledge and skills in various disciplines; * Apply the obtained knowledge in explaining daily processes, solving everyday questions.
