Vertebrate Zoology represents a course designed to explore the diversity of animals that possess backbones or their cartilage precursors. The lecture course will focus on the morphological, ecological, behavioral and physiological diversity within an evolutionary perspective. Major topics will include paleontology, phylogenetic hypotheses of relationships, comparative anatomy, functional morphology, natural history, and biogeography of fossil and living vertebrates.  As a part of the course we visit  the Tartu University Natural History Museum to see representatives of the different types of vertebrates in both whole and skeletonized form.
The lecture component is reinforced by practicals in which students will study representative live, preserved and/or model specimens of the different vertebrate groups and other relevant audiovisual materials.Dissection is utilized to study the organ systems of representatives of the classes.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The major emphasis of this course  to give a broad  survey of the biological diversity and evolution of the vertebrates. Special emphasis will be placed on functional morphology, physiology, paleontology, and ecology, as related to evolutionary history. The laboratory will introduce the student to the fundamentals of vertebrate anatomy through the dissection of different representatives of vertebrate animals.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to distinguish between major groups of vertebrates through a demonstrated understanding of their taxonomic classification and diversity. They also have aquired an ability to use different handbooks.
