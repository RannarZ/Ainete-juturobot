The following topics are covered: microbiomes of plants, animals and human, microbiomes in environmental and in engineered systems (incl urban environment), microbiome study methods, human host-microbiome interactionsObjectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of the course is to provide an overview of microbial communities related to different organisms (plant, animal, human). The course will provide an outline of the main terminology and concepts and will cover how microbiomes affect the host. Microbiomes of natural and engineered systems will be also considered and the interactions of microbiomes with human health are highlighted. The course will handle current methodologies to study microbiomes including metagenomics and other -omics technologies, modelling, culturing, and application of high-throughput sequencing approaches.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:
- apply the main concepts and terminology used to describe microbiome functionality;
- understand the diverse ways by which microbiomes contribute to host metabolism and health;
- demonstrate an understanding of the approaches used to study microbiomes.
