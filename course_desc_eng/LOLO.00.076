In the course on school biology will be given  a systematic and simplified overview of different disciplines of biology  ( anatomy and physiology, botany, zoology)  and  basic  biological processes (respiration, metabolism, reproduction, dispersal, movement, adaptation)  Attention will be especially given to typical misconceptions and the way how topics of biology are related to everyday life. The students  are taught to apply their knowledge of biology to problem solving, reasoning and decision-making, and to recognize and convincingly refute pseudo-scientific views.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give an overview of main problems of teaching biology at basic school level. The aim of studying school biology is to use problem-solving to gain a comprehensive overview of the diversity of life, the structures and functions of organisms, heredity, evolution and ecology, as well as main principles of environmental protection and introduce the uniqueness of humans and health lifestyles.  At the same time, the students gain overview of most important laws, theories, practical outputs and future trends in biology and professions in this field. In addition to academic knowledge, critical thinking and analytical skills are developed, which enables the application of biological knowledge in solving, justifying and making decisions in both scientific and everyday problems, and excludes acceptance of pseudo-scientific views.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The graduate student:
1. knows the content and theoretical fundamentals of the courses of biology in basic school;
2. knows the main goals of the biology teaching and the knowledge acquired in school biology;
3. is able to apply his knowledge in the explanation of biology problems and to compose problem exercises for students and exploratory study of biological processes used in teaching;
4. are familiar with the most common misconceptions in the field of biology and the school is able to teach the students to organize any advance;
5. is able to connect the problems of school biology with the problems of everyday life and of other natural sciences;
