In addition, neurotrophic and metabolic aspects of behavioural regulation will be discussed. Understanding of neurochemistry is necessary in order to understand the effects of psychoactive drugs and to interprete data obtained with modern brain imaging techniques.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course in general is to acquire knowledge about the biochemical and molecular biological basis of mental functions.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who has completed the course knows basic biochemistry and topographical neuroanatomy of the main neurotransmitter systems, The student also knows neurotrophic and metabolic aspects of behavioural regulation.
