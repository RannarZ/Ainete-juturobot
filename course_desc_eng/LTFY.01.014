The course provides a comprehensive overview of spectroscopy (and in particular, the optical spectroscopy) and its applications. The main spectroscopic phenomena will be described and the relation of the spectra to the structure of matter will be analyzed. The operating principles of popular spectroscopic apparatus will be covered. The theoretical part is supported by practical works and demonstrations.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of the course is to introduce the fundamentals of spectroscopy, including the spectroscopic method and its applications, the main spectroscopic phenomena, and the operating principles of spectral apparatus.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing the course, the student knows (and can apply in basic situations): 1. The relation between spectroscopy and optics. 2. The common spectral coordinates (wavelength, wavenumber, frequency, energy), correspondingly convert the position of a spectral line. 3. The transmission, reflection and absorption coefficients and corresponding spectra, employ Bouguer'-Lambert-Beer law. 4. The observation conditions and spectral properties of Rayleigh scattering. 5. The distinction between thermal radiation and luminescence, the basic laws governing the blackbody emission. 6. The concepts of fluorescence quantum yield, excitation spectrum and decay time constant. 7. Bohr model of the atom, the elementary processes between radiation (photons) and matter (atoms) and qualitatively their (dis)similarities. 8. The energy level scheme (excl. fine structure) of the simplest atom and the connection with quantum numbers. 9. The simplest models of molecules and the emergence of Raman-peaks in the scattering spectra of molecules (incl. connection between Raman shift and molecular vibration frequency). 10. Qualitative relations between the energy zone structure of crystals and their basic optical properties. 11. The basic spectral features of common radiation sources (halogen, xenon and deuterium lamp, spectral lamps and lasers) and corresponding application possibilities in spectroscopy,  12. The function and operating principle of general-purpose spectral apparatus (monochromator, spectrophotometer, spectrofluorimeter); the meaning of dispersion, resolution and spectral slit, and the relations between the quantities. 13. The responsivity and spectral response of a detector and the working principles of the most common optical detectors (photomultiplier, photodiode, CCD).
