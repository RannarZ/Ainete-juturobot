The course starts with the overview of mathematical methods applied to physical applications.
In the course we focus on the following subjects:  vector- and tensor algebra in Euclidean 3-space, main operations of the vector- and tensor analysis, foundations of differential geometry, calculation of line and surface integrals, main theorems of vector analysis.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Provide a mathematical foundation for understanding of the subsequent courses in theoretical physics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  + understands the need to extend the class of scalar functions, knows the concept of vector and tensor fields and their transformation rules in coordinate transformations, + is able to use vector and tensor algebra and analysis in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, is familiar with the concepts and can be able to calculate scalar, vector and tensor field gradients and divergences and vector field rotor, + understands the physical meaning of gradient, divergence and rotor, + can calculate line, surface and space integrals and use related integral theorems, + is able to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, to bring the matrix to the normal form of Jordan and to apply this skill in the study of the fixed points of a dynamic system by writing approximate solutions, + knows the basic concepts of dynamical systems such as phase trajectory and phase portrait, fixed point and its types, bifurcation, deterministic chaos.
