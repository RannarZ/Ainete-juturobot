A student's responsibility is to assist the responsible teacher in seminars, creating and moderating the e-learning component (e.g. Moodle), operate with the learning materials (scanning, copying, composing etc.), administer questions and course related matters (e.g. collection of essays, calculating grades, forwarding feedback). The role of study assistant is not related to any teaching activity, such as lecturing, assessment, giving feedback, etc.
Study assistants are chosen based on their study performance and successful fulfillment of their own curricula.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Students' participation in the study process helps to create affiliation to the institute and develop skills of the most successful students, and therefore guide them towards the doctoral studies at the University of Tartu. The objective of the practice is to provide knowledge and experience in university-level teaching and to apply teaching and learning knowledge and skills in a didactic context. During practice a student can develop the skills of preparing studying materials, giving feedback, argumentation and active listening, helping out during seminars under supervision of the responsible lecturer, operating in e-learning environment (e.g. Moodle), and solving course related matters.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the practice a student knows the specificity of university-level teaching (e.g. knows how to prepare and teach a lecture course or a seminar, evaluate students' independent work, give feedback) and use active learning methods, i.e. e-learning.
