Combinatorial counting (factorials, estimates), double-counting (Sperner's lemma and theorem, Brouwer's fixed point theorem), Eulerian and planar graphs (five-color problem), trees and spanning trees, extremal graph theory (Turan's theorem), finite projective planes (Fano plane, orthogonal latin squares), finite probability spaces, Ramsey theory (Ramsey theorem, lower bound for Ramsey numbers).Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of the course is to expose students to a number of different subfields of combinatorics and develop their problem-solving ability in those areas.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Graduates of the course know and can apply basic combinatorial methods, including counting, double-counting, estimates, basic graph theory (Eulerian and planar graphs, trees, spanning trees, some extremal graph theory, Turan's theorem). They are familiar with finite projective planes, finite probability spaces and some Ramsey theory.
