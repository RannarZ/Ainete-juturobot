Theoretical problems of sedimentation processes, origin and properties of sedimentary material are discussed. Classifications of sediments and sedimentary rocks are characterised and an overview of continental (riverine, lacustrine, gravitational, glacial) and marine (coastal, shelf, ocean) sedimentation is given. Practical training of the research methods of sediments, especially siliciclastic sediments, limestones and dolomites from Estonia, in the laboratory forms an important part of this course.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give knowledge of sedimentary processes and consequences.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Successful student must: 1) have a knowledge about mineralogical composition, properties and genesis of main sedimentary componets. 2) be able to identify most common sedimentary rocks and know their classification. 3) know processes and characterizations of main continental and marine sedimentary environments. 4) Know and be able to use practically laboratory study methods of main sediments (siliciclastics, carbonates).
