The course gives an overview about the general cellular and molecular mechanisms of embryonic development and organogenesis. In the course the important signalling pathways of development will be handled and what processes they regulate. The focus is on the early mammalian development,  primordial germ cell specialization, body axes formation, and the molecular mechanisms of nervous system, limb, and heart development, as well as sex determination and embryonic pattern formation. The seminars cover original articles on these topics and provide an overview of the methodologies used in developmental biology research.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The general aim of the course is to provide the basic knowledge about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of development and organogenesis.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who have passed the course: 1) Orientates in terminology of developmental biology, understands the principle processes of development and can (create associations) make connections between different developmental mechanisms. 2) Can describe the most important signalling pathways and signalling molecules and bring examples of their functioning in different developmental processes. 3) Can describe the molecular mechanisms involved in the developmental stages discussed in the lectures (early development, body axis formation, germ cell development, nervous system development, heart development, limb development, sex determination). 4) Is aware of new methodologies and scientific advances in developmental biology.
