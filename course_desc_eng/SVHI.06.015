In the last couple of decades the pace of technological change and development has been increasing and ubiquitous. New digital technologies comprising services, applications and gadgets have been introduced and as a result many aspects of education have been re-imagined in the light of new possibilities concerning where, how, and when teaching and learning experiences can take place. Besides, digital technologies have been often called for in order to provide immediate solutions to problems related to the organization of teaching and learning as well as their effectiveness. However, such promises did not quite materialize. Conversely, the rapid pace at which new gadgets, services and tools have been introduced has generated an unprecedented variety and increased complexity, affecting the way in which education can have an impact on society.

The third part of the course will be devoted to presenting and sharing the insights gained during the inquiries conducted by the students.Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course is designed so as to give students the chance to think and subsequently develop conversations on the broader meaning that technology (and innovation) has or could have in education.
