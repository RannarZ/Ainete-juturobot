R is one of the leading and most powerful tools for data analysis, but it is considered to have a rather steep initial learning curve. This introductory course helps you over the hardest part, covering everything necessary to get started  with R. We will also go through the modern workflow in R using dplyr for data wrangling, grammar of graphics for both exploratory and publication-ready data visualization and give an basic overview of Rmarkdown, which helps to integrate the statistical analysis in report-writing.
