Algebraic basis is useful in finite-dimensional spaces: sequences converge if and only if their coordinates converge. Algebraic basis is almost useless in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces: there always are convergent sequences with non-convergent coordinates. A basis in an infinite-dimensional Banach space is a useful replacement of an algebraic basis of a finite-dimensional space. Topics are as follows. Algebraic basis and basis. Examples (including  wavelets). Basis problem and a live goose as the price for  its solution. Isomorphisms in Banach spaces. Basis criterion. Stability. Monotone bases. Shrinking bases. Boundedly complete bases. Types of convergence of series. Unconditional bases. Applications to the linear-topological structure of Banach spaces. James's space. Existence of basic sequences. Existence of unconditional basic sequences: problem and the Fields price (1998) for its solution. Schauder decompositions. Approximation properties.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Elective course for students in mathematics. Intended to give an opportunity to master and doctor students to become familiar with basics of the theory of bases in Banach spaces. This theory has many applications in functional analysis and various branches of mathematics (differential and integral equations, numerical analysis, etc).Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the course students have acquired basic knowledge and skills of the theory of bases in Banach spaces. In particular, they know the following basic notions and main results concerning them. Algebraic basis and basis. Examples (including wavelets). Basis problem and a live goose as the price for its solution. Isomorphisms in Banach spaces. Basis criterion. Stability. Monotone bases. Shrinking bases. Boundedly complete bases. Types of convergence of series. Unconditional bases. Applications to the linear-topological structure of Banach spaces. James's space. Existence of basic sequences. Existence of unconditional basic sequences: problem and the Fields price (1998) for its solution.
