Soil types and Engineering Geological division of Estonia into regions. Soils and their types. Composition of soil. Characteristics of soil: bulk density, water ratio, void ratio, compression rate, plastic limit, liquid limit. Mechanical characteristics of soil: rigidity, settlements, strength properties.
Geotechnical design principles: limiting states, settlements, surface water.
Foundations: shallow foundations, their support limit state, determining the measures for footing, service limit state, pole foundations, their types, the bearing capacity of poles, support walls, their work principles, design principles, hydro isolation.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Provide general knowledge of Estonian structural geological conditions, of the foundation usage and design principles.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon successful completion of the course students: -	can classify soil according to external characteristics; -	know major physical features of different types of soil and their identification methods; -	can assess the general suitability of subsoil for foundation base; -	can approximately determine the measures of simpler foundations; -	understand the functioning principle of support walls; -	can, in a simpler case, dimension support walls; -	understand the impact moisture and ground water have on the foundation both during building and exploitation; -	can, if necessary, solve problems related to ground water and moisture.
