The lecture course is an introduction into the basic calculational methods of differential geometry and their application to typical problems of theoretical physics.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The objective of the lecture course is to provide an introduction to differential geometry with examples and applications in theoretical physics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course the student knows the basic objects of differential geometry, in particular, manifolds, fiber bundles, sections, tensor fields, Lie groups and connections, and their application in classical mechanics, field theory and gravity. He / she can perform calculations using these objects and apply them to problems from theoretical physics.
