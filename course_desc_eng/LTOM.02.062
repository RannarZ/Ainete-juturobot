The course consists of several independent blocks. The first is the block of synoptic climatology, which gives an overview on history of synoptic climatology, deals with main classification methods of atmospheric circulation and advances in synoptic climatology. In the agricultural meteorology part of the course, plant demands regarding weather conditions during the summer and winter seasons, dangerous weather phenomena, distribution of agro-climatic sources in the world, and other related problems are discussed. The third block is dedicated to principals of climate modelling, description of main components of the climate system, parameterisation of physical processes, description of different climate models and their applications. In the final stage, some sophisticated statistical models for analysis of temporal and spatial variability are presented and problems related to global climate change are discussed.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Objective of the course is to give a detail overview and practical experience in different fields of climatology: synoptic climatology, agricultural meteorology and climatology, climate modelling, climatological data analysis and global climate change.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  .A student * knows the main terminology of synoptic climatology * can read, understand and analyse synoptic maps * knows the main classifications of atmospheric circulation for Europe * can describe the influence of different circulation types in Europe * knows the main agriclimatic characteristics and is able to calculate them * knows the needs of the main cultivares for weather and climatic conditions during different stages of the plant growth * knows agriclimatic conditions in the different regions of the World and cultivare adapted for them * knows the main components of the climate system and understands the influence of different factors on climate * understands feedback precesses in the climate system * generally understands the nature of climate modelling and areas of its application * can describe different types of climate models, their possibilities and outputs  * knows main parts of global and regional climate models * understands the horisontal and vertical resolution of climate models * describes generally the process of creation of climate change scenarios * knows possible consequences of global climate warming * knows the main statistical methods of climatic data precessing and is able to use them
