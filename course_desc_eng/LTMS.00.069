This course is the first of the basic courses in the mathematical analysis of real variables and delves into the following topics: the theory of real numbers, sequences and series, continuous and discontinuous functions, and differentiable functions.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of "Real Analysis I" is to treat in detail the following topics: the theory of real numbers, sequences and series, continuous functions, and differentiable functions.
 
To support critical thinking skills and to develop mathematical oral and written self-expression skills.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student who completes the course will:
1) Know the basic properties of real numbers; be able to find infima and suprema of subsets of real numbers; know the properties of absolute value and be able to prove them.
2) Know the concept of the limit of a sequence; recognize the main convergent and divergent sequences; know and be able to prove the properties of convergent sequences and the basic principles of convergence theory.
3) Know the concepts of the limit and continuity of a function; be able to state and prove the most important properties of continuous functions on an interval; be able to investigate the continuity of a function in simpler cases using both definitions and fundamental results.
4) Know the concepts of the derivative and differentiability of a function; be able to state and prove the fundamental theorems of differential calculus and apply them in simpler situations; be able to find the derivative of a function in simpler cases using the definition.
5) Choose appropriate mathematical concepts for solving problems and be able to apply them accordingly.
6) Examine and construct logical arguments within the framework of the mathematical concepts learned during the course.
7) Have developed mathematical written self-expression skills through tests and mathematical oral self-expression skills through practical sessions, lectures, and the exam; also have discussed the nature, proofs, and examples of mathematical concepts in the oral exam.
