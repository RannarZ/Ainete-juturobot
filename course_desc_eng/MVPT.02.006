Written assignments help the students to apply the principles of scientific research (including academic language usage) when planning their own master's thesis, and to get an understanding of the process, stages and types of research. The discussions carried out in seminars provide the students with an understanding of the principles of choosing research subjects or research material in accordance with the research plan and the principles of ensuring the trustworthiness of research. In practical classes, students practise searching scientific databases for sources of literature. In seminars, critical evaluation of sources of literature on the basis of checklists is also practised as well as producing arguments with regard to their own evaluations. An overview of the literature for the planned master's thesis is prepared individually. Practical written assignments enable the students to practise the planning of a research paper, drawing up a research plan and evaluating it critically, involving peer review. Documents needed to apply for research approvals are prepared.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To deepen the knowledge of the principles, requirements, and stages of scientific research, and the main types of research in nursing science.
