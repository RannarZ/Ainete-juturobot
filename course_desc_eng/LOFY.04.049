The basic concepts (i.e., metric, connection, curvature) of the Riemannian geometry are presented. The notion of geometrization of gravitational field (the equivalence of
inertial and gravitational fieldes) is introduced, and the necessity to use for a dynamical description of the time-space theory the Einstein gravitation field equations
is founded on. Some solutions (linear approximation, gravitational waves, black holes, expanding universe) of the Einstein gravitation field equations, as well as the 
experimental confirmations, the Einstein theory are discussed.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to acquire the basic knowledges about Riemannian geometry, foundations of general theory of relativity and main applications of the theory: black holes, cosmology and gravitational waves.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student passed through the course: ------------------------------------------------------------------- * understands the demand to consider different reference frames, principle of equivalence, principle of general relativity * knows the foundations of Riemannian geometry   * knows concepts which is counted in program and can explain their meaning * knows basic equation of the theory, understands phenomenons which are described by these equations and can be able to use these equations for solving problems * understands the role and place of general theory of relativity in world-view of natural sciences
