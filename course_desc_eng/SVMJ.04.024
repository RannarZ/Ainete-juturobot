The first block  of the course includes lecturers on the following topics: 1) measuring and quantifying trade flows and trade policies; 2) The Gravity Model of International Trade: Introduction and Theoretical Foundations; 3) Estimating Structural Gravity (partial equilibrium): Analytical tools and applications; 4) General Equilibrium Analysis with the Gravity Model. Theory, Tools and Applications; 5) Other applications of gravity models: FDI, Migration. The second block of the course consist of hands-on lab sessions where students will apply the tools acquired in the 1st block using STATA. Students will have two main types of assignments: i) replication of published papers using gravity models; ii) research project. The research projects will be presented at the end of the course.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is by building on the theoretical insights gained in international trade and skills developed in applied econometrics to develope the empirical skills required for the quantification of trade flows and for trade policies impact evaluation.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After taking the course students will be able to use the structural gravity model in partial and general equilibrium settings in order to estimate and predict the effects of trade and trade-related policies on trade flows, on welfare, and on the distribution of income.
