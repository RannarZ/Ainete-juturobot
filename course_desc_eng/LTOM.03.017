After completing this course you should have understood that the history of Earth and life was not a nice straightforward road but a process with such a complexity that however in-depth university course would still be comparable with prying into a keyhole.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is, first, to demonstrate that - from the evolutionary point of view - humans are much less important than it is usually percieved. Among all these billions of creatures who have ever inhabited the Earth or will do so in the future, our species is but a minor actor.
Second, to demonstrate, that he/she himself/herself is a heir of much more successful ancestors than he/she has ever been assuming - all his/her ancestors have been fortunate enough to live up to the adulthood  and have managed to pass their genes to the offspring.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  This course  *	inspires to ask questions about the origin of the modern biological diversity  *	teaches how to join the view on modern life with the view on the life that has disappeared long time ago *	directs to notice how the million-year-old evolutionary patterns are reflected in the modern world  *	advises to avoid the anthropocentric view on our planet, but *	helps to notice how the evolutionary processes are connected with our own species and our civilization *	shows how the methods and concepts of different disciplines are employed to understand the history of life
