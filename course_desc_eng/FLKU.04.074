The course begins with a general introduction to the history of folkloristics, its Basic research problems, and conceptual ground. Next, we shall examine some fields in folklore that have been thoroughly studied in Estonian research tradition. Thirdly, we shall focus on certain case studies to see how the concepts and methods of folkloristics can be applied in scholarship.
The course includes also an excursion to the Estonian Folklore Archives.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to share basic knowledge on academic research of folklore: 1) to discuss the phenomenon of folklore in relation to other fields of cultural research, 2) to give an overview of the most important folklore genres, their social and cultural functions, both in diachronic and synchronic perspective, 3) to introduce folkloristics as a discipline, its history, key concepts and research methods.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students who successfully pass this course will be able to:
