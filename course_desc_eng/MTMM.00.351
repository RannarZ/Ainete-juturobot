In this course we deal with real-life problems, that require the application of mathematics. Mathematical knowledge and skills covered include finding relationships, using various calculation techniques, creating and interpreting graphs, tables, diagrams etc, representing functions, converting units, percents, recognizing proportional and inverse proportional dependence, solving for unknown variables, estimating results when using approximate calculations, solving textproblems, modelling situations.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Goals of the course are 1) to develop student's mathematical literacy, i.e. ability to notice problem solving possibilities in those situations where mathematics can be applied, to be able to ask questions, solve and analyze problems, interpret the results, carry out logical argumentations and present results to your peers; 2) to give an overview and provide reasons for using mathematical literacy in various natural science classes.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing this course a student can 1) use mathematical process skills to identify, pose and solve problems creatively and critically; 2) work effectively with others as members of a team; 3) collect, analyse, organise and critically evaluate information; 4) communicate effectively using visual, symbolic and/or language skills in various modes;
