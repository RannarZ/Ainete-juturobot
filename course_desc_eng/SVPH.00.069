Financial decisions are an important part of our lives and understanding the psychological reasons behind them has both personal and professional implications. During this course we look into economic behaviour, focussing mainly on the perception of value and risk. We cover Prospect Theory, temporal discounting and other key concepts that explain economic decisions. The application of these theories extends financial decisions and relates to other domains in life, helping make sense of how we value rewards and risks in general.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To develop a better understanding of how people perceive value and risks.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  * Understands and applies the findings of Prospect Theory
