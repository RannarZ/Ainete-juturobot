The course requires no musical hearing and is open to all. We will go through 10 stages from the birth of creation to eternity. We will discuss the impact of narrative embedded in the creation at each stage. We will analyse the credibility of the message contained in the creation, and, using the human voice as an example, we will learn how to convey a compelling and believable message using suitable techniques. We will reflect on the world-enhancing possibilities of good narrative delivery. We will learn techniques for listening to music or consuming any creation to enhance its positive impact on our creativity and mental well-being. We will discuss the impact of creation on different scales, from home to the song festival. Several of the lectures will feature panel discussions, and experts in their fields will be invited. Each lecture will include practical music listening. The course requires active participation and delivers the content more holistically by being physically present.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course aims - to develop the ability to understand the plausibility of the narrative used in a work of art and the possibilities of its impact (using music and human voice as an example); - to broaden the knowledge of the creative process more widely through the example of music; - to develop the ability to listen to music or use any creation to cultivate one's mental well-being and creativity.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student who completes the course - can understand the plausibility of a narrative using the example of differences in the human voice; - has a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the processes of musical composition/production; - can use techniques for listening to music or consuming any creation to enhance the positive impact on one's own creativity and mental health.
