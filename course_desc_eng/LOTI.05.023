Students will be asigned into groups of 3 to 4 people. Each team will build a robot that complies with the rules of Robotex (http://www.robotex.ee). 
Building a robot consists of:
    building a chassis
    installing of sensors
    the interconnecting of sensors and actuators with microcontrollers
    programming of microcontrollers
    testing of finished solution
All students with some knowledge in mechanics, low level programming, high level programming or project and team management are welcome.
Each team will be composed in such a way that the skills of members will complement eachother.
To attend the course, you will need to attend the kickoff camp. More information will be given in the first lecture.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The purpose of the course is to teach to use knowledge and practical know-how in electronics, mechanics, mechantronics, design and management of mechatroncs project and teamwork. During the course student teams will build a robot which succeeds in performing a predefined task.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Finish a hardware project in a group where time is of the essence. Quickly aqcuire missing knowledge.
