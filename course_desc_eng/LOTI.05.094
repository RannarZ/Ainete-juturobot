The purpose of this course is to give students a basic knowledge of modern telecommunications technologies that are used in the design and operation of modern transmission systems.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Develop knowledge in the field of Telecommunication technologies. To study signals and various transmission systems, signal processing methods and coding in telecommunications. Long distance signal transmission, communication lines, characteristics of communication channels are also covered. The knowledge is applied in the analysis of various transmission systems, in assessing the main electrical characteristics of the channels, and paths of the equipment of transmission systems.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students prepare for jobs related to the design of digital telecommunications networks, digital processing of telecommunications signals (coding and compression of speech and image signals, digital modulation), design and operation of telecommunications (transmission, switching and data transmission systems), as well as design of telecommunications (telephone, data transmission and integrated) networks. Students acquire the ability to solve system problems that require comprehensive knowledge in the field of telecommunications.
