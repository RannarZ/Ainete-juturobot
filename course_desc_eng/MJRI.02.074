Students can practice in different companies and organizations (ministries, agencies, local governments, banks, universities, OÜ, NGOs, etc.), set up their own company, participate in research groups or participate in projects. The student chooses the type of internship according to his / her developmental needs and outcomes of the curriculum. During the internship, the student has to follow the tasks set in Moodle.
