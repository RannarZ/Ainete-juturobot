A hackathon is an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects (may include a hardware component as well). There is no restriction on the type of software being created. Hackathons can have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, or the subject. Valid hackathons for this course should last at least 2 days. The goal is to create usable software that can later be demonstrated during course evaluation.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this course is to encourage students to practice their professional skills through participating in different hackathons connected to software development or hardware.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon successful completion of this course the student will be able to apply their analytical and programming skills to fulfill the goals set jointly in an interdisciplinary team.
