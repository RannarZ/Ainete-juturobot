The aim of the course is to provide knowledge of the nature and applications of gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. The course deals with the theory of chromatography, describes methods of qualitative and quantitative analysis, explains principles of apparatus and materials used for analysis, presents methods of pre-processing of samples and explains possibilities of interpretation of results.Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course is meant to introduce preparative (Prep.C), gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GCMS), to give overview of theoretical principles, data processing methods and applications.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  1. Students know the classification of chromatographic methods, correct terminology and general theoretical aspects of chromatography. 2. Students have an overview of methods, types and the most important practical aspects of preparative chromatography (Prep C). 3. Students understand the general principles and design of the apparatus used in gas

chromatography and mass spectrometry, and will be aware of the impact of different work parameters on the results of the analysis. 4. Students know the procedures of qualitative and quantitative analysis and have an overview of the modern data processing software. 5. Students know main materials used in GC, their properties and applications. 6. Students know the principles and apparatus used for pre-treatment of samples. 7. Students can practically carry out gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry experiments. 8 Students understand main trends of development of GC and GCMS methods in the world.
