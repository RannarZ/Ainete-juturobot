Medical Biochemistry is completely human organism-oriented topic for dentists. The following problems are highlighted: a) basic biomolecules of human body (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids), their biofunctions, disorders and main diseases (biochemical-medical  background of the metabolic disorders in the case of carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids); b) biochemistry of saliva, extracellular matrix, bone, teeth; c) clinically important biochemical aspects of biotransformation and detoxification of xenobiotics (including drugs); d) contemporary biochemical analysis of science-based human nutrition; e) clinically informative markers of human body biofluids; f) assay of proteins and clinical marker enzymes in biofluids of human body.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to give an updated discussion of the selected and medical relevant knowledge of human body basic biomolecules and the metabolic pathways underlying the functions of human body; to provide the students with knowledge about the oxidative stress and oxidative stress-driven diseases (including caries, periodontitis, gingivitis); to give an updated basics of nutrition, extracellular matrix and bone (tooth) metabolism and disorders of calcium and phosphate metabolism, and to develop student's biochemical-medical thinking. The latter is needed: a) for understanding the molecular mechanism of functioning the human organism and development of diseases (especially connective tissue); b) for using the medical biochemistry experience and knowledge permanently developing science-based dental practice.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who graduated the course: a)	orientates in biochemical-medical knowledge, can describe human metabolic key-pathways  and their medical impact and role; b)	possesses knowledge about human body metabolism, about metabolism of macro- and microminerals, extracellular matrix, bones, relationship and role of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis diseases (especially caries, periodontitis, gingivitis) and about biochemistry of saliva; c)	can apply biochemical-medical knowledge into every day permanently developing science based  practical work.
