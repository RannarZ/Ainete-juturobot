The seminar deals with the terms 'culture' and 'interculturality' both in a historical and in a systematic perspective. It will first focus on the development of ideas about national culture and a global approach to humankind. It will then look at destructive consequences of ideas about national cultures and the construction of the other, compare that to more recent ideas about interculturality in different scientific fields and finally apply these theories to key examples of contemporary German language literature and filmObjectives/eesmärkid:  This course will provide the students with a general grasp of the central issues concerning culture and interculturality. By closely analysing key texts of cultural theory from the 18th to the 21st century and by applying them to contemporary German language literature and film, the students will widen their understanding of identity building processes in relation to ideas about the collective and internationality. This will contribute largely to the development of critical thinking and academic skills. The course's language is German.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course, the students will be thoroughly familiar with key texts of cultural and intercultural theory, as well as with some examples of contemporary German language literature and film.
They will have developed an understanding of the concepts of culture and interculturality and will be able to apply them to the national, European and international contexts, as well as to literature and film.
They will be able to recognize, define and explain various theoretical approaches to culture and interculturality. 
They will be able to compare different perspectives and their effects and have thus developed their own position about culture, including their own. 
They will have trained their reading and analytical skills of highly complex theory, primary and secondary literature, as well as of film. They will also have developed and applied their own methodological and theoretical skills in academic oral and written exercises, thus developed their presentational skills.
They will have learned to compare texts and periods, and produce a cogent, clearly structured evaluation.
They will also have developed and practised transferable skills such as problem solving, data analysis, communication skills, time management, work ethics, listening and providing feedback.
They will have developed digital skills such as using search engines and data banks while being aware of their structure and operation modes so that they can critically evaluate the sources and their reliability. Furthermore, they have practised using various word processing functions and creating content in different formats.
