The course gives an overview of the main concepts and models used to describe  structure and properties of materials. Respective problems are solved in practice lessons.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of the course is to give a systematic picture of the models and concepts of solid state physics and quantum mechanics for describing structure and properties of materials, and for choice and design of materials for several applications.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course the student has a picture of models and concepts of solid state physics and quantum mechanics for describing  materials, on the basis of these models he/she is able to perform calculations of materials properties and choose  materials for several applications.
