The most significant general features of the new literature (poetry and prose) are situated in the context of these social and cultural changes.  This in turn serves as the basis for examining the works of several prose writers and poets, attending to the thematic and stylistic specificity of each author. Finally, all treatments of individual authors are relate back to general changes, in view of the broader context of contemporary Estonian literature.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To examine the changes that took place in the 1990s and the first decade after the year 2000 in literary consciousness and literary life, and to analyize the works of the most significant authors of this period.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of the course the student: - Comprehends the fundamental change that has taken place in the poetics of contemporary Estonian literature as compared to literature of previous eras - Knows the historical and cultural background of this breakthrough, its central authors, works, and poetics  - Shows mastery of the basic concepts and vocabulary required  for the analysis of modernist- postmodernist contemprary literature - Has read those texts considered most important or of central signifcance when viewed from the perspective of contemporary literature.
