Different teaching methods are used. Several times a week, students are expected to work on the material and clinical data of prepared clinical cases. Students are expected to present their findings individually and also as members of their group. Based on practical examples, the module thus provides an overview of how clinical nutritionists can contribute to the optimisation of treatment regimens by using and applying their knowledge. As before, learners are tested informally with short interactive quizzes. Normal gastrointestinal function is essential for normal nutrition. Disease affects consumption, digestion, absorption and can cause abnormal losses. These are all covered and there is teaching on the key diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim is for the student to have a clear understanding of the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract, and how disease causes nutritional problems. The student is helped to understand and justify the primacy of enteral nutrition, but is able to predict when parenteral nutrition is needed. By analysing a wide variety of gastrointestinal diseases, the student sees most of the ways in which impaired function causes poor nutrition.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student completing the module: * understands the physiology of digestion and absorption * is able to apply this knowledge in understanding the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal diseases * understands the scientific basis for the superiority of enteral nutrition * knows the consequences of short bowel syndrome and its nutritional management * is familiar with the necessary nutritional interventions for all major intestinal and pancreatic diseases
