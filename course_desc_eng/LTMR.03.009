This course contains the application of transgenic techonologies to plants, mammals, fish and bacteria. It covers the production of transgenic plants and how this technology has resulted in genetically engineered crop plants that have improved qualities or produce novel plant products. The course also covers the use of genetically modified bacteria to produce insulin and other medicines. The ability to modify the mammalian genome is one of the most powerful technologies for defining gene function and regulation. This course will also focus on the use of genetically modified animals to deliniate gene regulation and develop models for human disease. Both historical approaches and state-of-the art methodologies will be discussed. The use of transgenic, knock-in and conditional knock-out technologies to study findings from in vitro experiments in an in vivo settings to understand the mechanisms of human and other diseases or fundamental biological processes will be discussed. This course also considers how the release of engineered organisms is having an impact on society raising issues of economic and ecological importance. The EU's directives on legislation concerning GMOs (genetically modified organisms) will be discussed.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this course is to give an overview of development, production, use and application of genetically modified organisms (includingGMO bacteria, plants, fish and mammals), evaluation of the potential risks arising out of activities involving the use of genetically modified organisms and legislation that applies to the use of genetically modified organisms.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  .
