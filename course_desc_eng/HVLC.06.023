The classes require active participation, we do a lot of group- and pairwork. There is also a great focus on independent work. 

The course has its own web module on Moodle, containing lesson materials, comments on grammar, interactive exercises, links to useful resources etc. We will also learn to use different online language learning resources, including dictionaries.
