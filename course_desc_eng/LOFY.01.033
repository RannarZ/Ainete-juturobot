The principle of laser operation and related parameters (like gain, lasing threshold, saturation intensity)  are illustrated by the analysis of  mathematical models (for example a four-level system). Gaussian beam as a base model of a laser beam is treated in detail. The generation of an ultrashort (pico- and femtosecond)  pulse train by mode locking and the generation of high-energy pulses by Q-switching  as well as nonlinear conversion of  laser radiation (second harmonic generation, optical parametric amplification) is also covered. A variety of laser types are reviewed, by introducing  their design and operating parameters. The subject is intended mostly for the master students specializing in applied physics and fundamental physics.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To understand the physics, describing the operation and the control of a laser and the properties of a laser beam.  To get an idea about a diversity of  laser designs and about a wide variety of laser applications. To comprehend laser-related and laser-application-related issues and to cope with them more efficiently.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student who pass the course will know  the design, the operating principle, the order of output parameters, and the possibilities for application of the most important types of laser and is able to search for additional information, know the basic terms, concepts and principles of laser physics and is able to formulate and  explain them, understand mathematical models describing various aspects of laser functioning and the properties of laser light and is able to solve simpler problems of laser physics.
