The course introduces a relatively new field of study —ecosemiotics. Ecosemiotic research concentrates on the relations between natural and cultural environment and on the cultural mechanisms, which create and/ or balance environmental conflicts. 
The essentials of ecosemiotics are discussed in the course by comparing the discipline with other academic fields investigating the man-nature relationship (e.g. cultural ecology, human ecology, human geography). A "history of ideas approach" is used to demonstrate the development of environmentalist ideas in Western cultures.
In addition to the theoretical and practical uses of ecosemiotics, also basic knowledge of ecology is provided along with the introduction of the main environmental problems and their cultural sources.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To introduce the theoretical grounds of ecosemiotics as well as its applications and key-authors; to provide a survey of the development of environmentalist thinking in the West and to discuss several modern understandings of man's place in the ecosystem.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student, who has passed the course: 1)	explains how have today's most critical ecological problems come into being and what has been the role of cultural and philosophical traditions in creating those problems; 2)	is familiar with the theoretical grounds of ecosemiotics and with its methods of analysis and can apply them independently; 1)	has an overview of the most substantial environmentalist authors and their works.
