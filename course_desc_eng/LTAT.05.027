The main modules in the course include: Introduction in blockchain application, Blockchain foundation and development, Blockchain for logistics and supply chain management, Blockchain for enterprise IT security and Blockchain for business.Objectives/eesmärkid:  1.	Define the essential blockchain characteristic; address the fundamental features of blockchain technology.  2.	Select appropriate technical options for blockchain design and implementation; specify, refine, update and make available a formal approach to design solutions, necessary to develop and operate a blockchain application.  3.	Introduce how the characteristics of blockchain technology can disrupt and/or innovate existing business models and business processes; examine existing blockchain-based use cases in industries such as finance, public services, provenance, supply chains etc.  4.	Introduce process- and state-based modelling languages suitable for requirement analysis and design of blockchain applications; identify a use case, selection of suitable platform, design a solution that delivers value, and develop a proof of concept in accordance with defined specifications.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  *	Identify and explain the foundations, architecture, concepts, principles, and technologies that were presented in the course, including their key terminology, underlying assumptions, and how they relate to one another.
