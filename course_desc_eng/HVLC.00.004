After having formed small groups/teams, students will plan and organise different activities and events (supervised by the supervisor), e.g specialty-related theme nights, exhibitions, fairs etc at non-university institutions where the students have different role from their everyday student role. After participating in practical training students compile a report in which one of the most important components is self analysis.
The work of study assistants carried out in the university and project-based practice that mainly has non-university base is treated as an exception. Supervisors are needed on the behalf of the university and the trainee base for conducting practical training. After the end of the training the trainee base's supervisor gives feedback to the supervisor of university's side, how the trainee managed with his/her tasks, developed during the training, what kind of preparations were made by the student for the training, etc.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Gaining experience from working in a group; learning how to self-evaluate your progress as a team member and taking responsibility for tasks given within the team.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students are able to reflect their experience gained in teamwork at a non-university institution; can evaluate their input and accomplishments during their work; they are able to distinguish between different roles in a team and are aware of ways of communication and shared responsibilty within a team.
