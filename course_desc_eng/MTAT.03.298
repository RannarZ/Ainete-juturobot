Robotics is a fast growing area in Estonian schools, which helps to apply knowledge from various school subjects in solving different practical tasks. Several robotics sets like BeeBot, mBot, LEGO Mindstorms EV3, Arduino ja Raspberry Pi from all school key stages are assembled in the course. Also the course participants are prepared for conductiong robotics lessons supporting them with topics like buying robotics devices, organizing lessons, advertising, preparing and conducting the lessons. Course consists of four 4-hour long practical sessions and e-learning between the lessons.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The student gets prepared for teaching the school key stages I-III and secondary school robotics in a robotics lesson.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing the course, stundent will be able: * to describe schoolrobotics history and spread in Estonian schools; * to assemble at least one school robotics robot; * to use readings from robotics basic sensors guiding the robot to solve practical tasks; * to program robots in graphical an textual programming environments.
