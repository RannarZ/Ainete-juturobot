The course starts by discussing the mission of International Relations as a discipline driven by specific practical and theoretical concerns, followed by a short introduction into the evolution of the discipline. The second, and main, part of the course includes a series of lectures and seminars which focus on the key formative concepts, such as sovereignty, anarchy and governance, agency, structure and the state, international system and international society, power, security, war and peace, conflict and cooperation, norms and identity, the role of the individual. The concepts are introduced through some of the classical texts that have shaped the discipline over decades; as a rule, each concept is introduced both from the rationalist and the constructivist perspective, and where possible, also through the prism of empirical issues. The concluding part of the course sums it up by linking the problematic of IR with the notion of modernity and asking whether today's practice of world politics is evolving beyond modernity or back to pre-modern times.Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course introduces the students to the current state of IR as a discipline. It discusses key practical and theoretical concerns that define the discipline, main theoretical debates, and key concepts that organise the disciplinary field.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completing the course, the students will be able to: 1) understand the disciplinary logic of IR and its evolution since the beginning of the twentieth century; 2) understand the key dividing lines between the rationalist and constructivist approaches in contemporary IR; 3) understand how and why IR theories differ in their approach to the key concepts that shape the disciplinary field; 4) improve their critical reading skills; 5) enhance their ability to use scholarly concepts in speech and in writing.
