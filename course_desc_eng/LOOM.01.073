This course treats examples of ecological applications in agriculture, forestry, greenery and environmental protection. Process of moving from theoretical generalisations to practical solutions is explored.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course educates specialists who are able to find practical and sustainable solutions stemming from ecological theory in the areas like agriculture, forestry, wild-life management and environmental protection.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  1. Student knows the main fields of research of applied ecology. 2. Student knows about the possibilities to fulfil our energy requirements and how realistic these possibilities are.
