The course includes introduction to investigation methods in engineering geology, physical and mechanical properties of a soil, and stress distribution in the ground. Different engineering geology related problems (settlement, strength issues, slope instabilities, groundwater issues, and pollution) and solutions are discussed. Practical tasks and examples are embodied in theoretical lectures. Individual tasks include homework exercises, compilation of a summary about a scientific case study paper and oral presentation in seminar. The course ends with a written exam.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The purpose of course is to provide student basic knowledge of geological factors and properties of soils and rocks that influence planning and building activities. After completing the course a student is able to evaluate the occurrence of typical engineering geology related problems and provide basic solutions to these problems.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing the course a student: 1. Can describe the field of engineering geology, main engineering geology related problems, and the main investigation methods and their limitations in engineering geology. 2. Understands and is able to explain the concept and relations of physical and mechanical properties of a soil, and is able to identify and compare different soil types based on these properties. 3. Can describe the concepts of groundwater movement, and is able to detect and solve basic groundwater related problems in engineering geology. 4. Can describe the concept of groundwater and soil pollution, its distribution mechanisms and main remediation methods. 5. Understands and is able to describe the concept of stress distribution, settlement and strength in soil, and can calculate these parameters in simple conditions. 6. Can identify and describe potential engineering geology related problems in different soil and groundwater conditions and offer basic solutions to these problems.
