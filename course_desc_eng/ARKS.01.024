The major respiratory disorders and diseases of the chest, including diseases of the mediastinum, esophagus, and chest wall are discussed in details (epidemiology, etiology and pathogenesis, signs and symptoms, clinical course, diagnosis (including invasive diagnostics), differential diagnosis, treatment (including surgery), rehabilitation, prevention, common respiratory health care, and management of respiratory emergencies) along with methods of investigation, in respiratory medicine, pulmonary pathology, pathophysiology, immunology, and defense mechanisms of the lung. The attention paid on different pulmonary disorders vary - diseases of higher prevalence are discussed in more details (i.e. bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory tract infections and their complications, thoracic neoplasms, and diseases of the pleura), but relatively less prevalent respiratory diseases, where invasive diagnostic methods are often used, are also taught. The Course on Pulmonary Medicine and Thoracic Surgery accounts for a part of the Course on Internal Medicine taught in the University of Tartu.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The purpose of the subject is to provide the medical students with the essentials in the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory disorders and diseases of the chest (including invasive diagnostics and surgical treatment) that comprises both theoretical knowledge and skills needed to solve practical situations. Apart from the respiratory diseases, the subject aims at providing essentials in diagnosis and surgical treatment of diseases of the mediastinum, esophagus, and chest wall.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the course, the students should be able to:  1) understand the principles of the nature and diagnosis of the diseases of the chest and respiratory system, as well as the basic methods of investigation used in chest medicine with an ability to interpret the results,  2) understand the essentials of pulmonary epidemiology, pathology, pathophysiology, immunology, and defense mechanisms of the chest and respiratory system,  3) autonomously investigate the pulmonary patient and suggest the preliminary diagnosis of major respiratory diseases including restrictive, obstructive, neoplasmatic, and infectious pulmonary diseases, as well as chest injury and diseases of the mediastinum, esophagus, and chest wall,  4) suggest further methods of investigations necessary to confirm the diagnosis in certain situations and interpret the respective results,  5) suggest and substantiate complex treatment options, including surgical treatment, in various respiratory diseases,  6) understand the principles of continuity of the respiratory care, pulmonary rehabilitation, and disease prevention,  7) know the principles of assessment of the patient and provide appropriate care in cases of respiratory emergencies and exacerbations of chronic respiratory disorders.
