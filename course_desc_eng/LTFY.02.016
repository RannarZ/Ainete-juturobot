The course (lectures, seminars and practical works) is recommended for bachelor students of materials science and master students of chemistry and physics, and also for a wide range of master and PhD students of biology, geology, archaeology, medicine etc., whose scientific interests are connected with different microscopy and local characterization and analysis methods of solid/solidified samples, their surfaces and subsurface areas, and films/coatings. In the course the first knowledge of optical microscopy, scanning probe microscopy (scanning tunnelling-, atomic force-, nearfield scanning optical microscopies), electron microscopy (scanning electron-, transmission electron microscopy), photoelectron spectroscopy/microscopy, electron microprobe analysis and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and secondary ion mass spectrometry, and connected with them equipment and analysis methods are introduced. Practical exercises cover the works with optical-, atomic force and  scanning electron microscopes, X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, and with the sample preparation.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to introduce to the students the main microscopic and physical analytical methods of solid samples, such as optical microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopies, X-ray microanalysis, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, photoelectron spectrometry, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The course has also the aim to give to students the first practical experience for working with optical reflection microscope, scanning electron- and probe microscopes and X-ray fluorescence spectrometer.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student passing through the course:
* Knows and understands the main microscopy and physical analysis methods. Uses correctly (orally and in writing) the main terms of microscopy and physical analysis methods in both English and Estonian languages.
* Has base knowledge of the vacuum techniques used;
* Knows and understands the working principles of optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopes and scanning probe microscopes, electron and X-ray fluorescence- and electron spectrometers and X-ray microanalyzers, secondary ion mass-spectrometers, and knows their applications, where and for what this type of analyzing equipment are used;
* Obtains the first practical experiences for solid samples characterization with reflective optical-, scanning electron and atomic force microscopes, and X-ray fluorescence spectrometers, and with the preparation of the samples.
