The following main general chemistry subjects are treated: purification of substances, preparation of solutions and titration, pH, redox reactions, chemical kinetics and chemical equilibria. The students acquire the primary laboratory experience and solve problems corresponding to practical work.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the practical work is to get the primary laboratory experience and knowledge of calculations associated to the appropriate subject.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student knows:
- theoretic backround of chemical experiments
Student is able to:
-work safely in the chemistry laboratory
-use correctly the basic labware
-carry out simple qualitative and quantitative laboratory experiments (weighing, measuring different volumes, heating, recrystallisation, preparing of solutions, titration)
-carry out simple calculations
