Actual problems of spectroscopic research in structure and microdynamics of matter (optical spectroscopy and its applications, relations between structure and properties of materials etc.) are dealt with. Reports (original/review) are prepared, presented and discussed.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of the seminar is to give the audience information on modern spectroscopy and related areas as well as to introduce seminar as an essential form of scientific activities via active participation of students.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student, after passing the course 1. Has general ideas on organization of a scientific seminar as a form of research and communication. 2. Has an overview on problems of modern spectroscopy and materials physics dealt with at the seminar. 3.
