For the dissertation, the student is shown how to use the literature, how to describe his/her methodology, how to present the results and how to discuss them intelligently.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the master's project is to develop the student's independent research skills within the framework of a clinical nutrition research project.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student completes his or her master's work with the dissertation.
