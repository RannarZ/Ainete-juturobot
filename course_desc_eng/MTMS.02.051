First an overview of mathematics of interest, specially about annuities is given. After that the survival models and life tables are discussed. Using the results of interest and survival theory the actuarial present values (APV) for elementary life insurances and life annuities are introduced.  By giving the total loss as a difference between APV of benefits and APV of premiums the equivalence principle is defined. By using equivalence principle the formulas for net premiums and net premium reserves  are derived. All the theory is illustrated with examples and exercises.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to provide an overview of the basic concepts of life insurance mathematics and elementary insurance types by combining risk theory, economics and population theory.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Passing through the module, a participant - has an overview of the theory of interest and knows different types of interest rates; - can describe the model of future lifetime and has an overview of the corresponding analytical distributions and Life Table; - knows elementary life insurance types and life annuities and can calculate their present values; - understands the concept of equivalence principle and can calculate net premiums and net premium reserves;
