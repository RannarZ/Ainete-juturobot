The following topics is discussed: sources of x-rays and electron irradiation, interaction of ionizing radiation with condensed matter, synchrotron radiation and its applications, x-ray and electron spectroscopy techniques.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this course is to give an overview of various ionizing radiations, their interactions with matter, subsequent research techniques and related literature.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the course students: - Know the elementary processes of interaction of ionizing radiations and matter; - Know the possibilities and limitations of research methods basing on the interaction of ionizing radiations with matter, are able to select research method(s) for solving of a problem; - Know the principles of generation of synchrotron radiation, the basic optical schemes used for monochromatization and focussing of synchrotron radiation, and applications of synchrotron radiation; - Are able to work with literature dealing with the interactions of ionizing radiations and matter.
