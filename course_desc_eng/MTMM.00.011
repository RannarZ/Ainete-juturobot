Main consepts of general topology, main classes of topological spaces and properties connected with continuity of maps are introduced.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To introduce main concepts of general topology.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing this course every student 1.recognizes main concepts of general topology and is able to describe these in noncomplicated cases;  2.is able to make sure which complect σ of subsets of a set X defines a topology on X such that σ is a base of this topology, and which  does not; 3.knows what is the subset topology, the quotient topology and the product topology and is able to describe main concepts (as closed set, closure of a set and accumulation points of a set) in these topologies; 4.knows equivalent conditions for the continuity of map and is able to use these in noncompli-cated cases; 5.knows what means the homeomorphism and perceives the importance of this in topology; 6.knows what is the (directed) net and what can be described by nets in topology; 7.knows most important topological spaces and their properties; 8.knows why we need to extend topological spaces, what means the one-point compactifi-cation of a topological space and how to describe the topology of such compactification; 9.knows properties of compact spaces and understands the importance of such spaces in mathematics; 10.knows which topological spaces are connected and separable and knows main properties of these spaces.
