The interface between systems biology and synthetic biology will be thoroughly discussed.  The principle "Build life to understand it" will be analyzed and studied using specific examples.  Conventionally, biologists have sought to understand life as it exists. Increasingly, however, from stem-cell reprogramming to microbial factories, researchers are describing what is and exploring what could be. A large part of the course will be dedicated to theoretical introduction into the mathematical modeling methods for systems biology. This part will serve as groundwork for the following practical modeling course using MATLAB ("Systems Modeling" 4EAP).Objectives/eesmärkid:  Specific examples of cutting edge studies from recent literature will be discussed with the aim to give the participants skills and ideas for designing their own interesting and competitive research projects in the field of systems biology. At this point the quantitative systems-level thinking about biomolecular systems should be galvanized in the student's minds, providing them an excellent basis for starting their master and doctorate projects.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The course presents a more advanced approach as a subsequent step after the introductory course LTTI.00.008 Systems Biology (4 EAP).
