Medical Biochemistry  is completely human organism-based topic  which uses contemporary new original specific textbooks. In particularly, the following problems are highlighted: -basic biomolecules of human body (disorders of structure and diseases); -clinically informative biochemical parameters of several fluids of human body; -assay of proteins and several clinical marker enzymes in fluids of human body; -biochemical background of the metabolic disorders in the case of carbohydrates, lipids, aminoacids, nucleic acids; -biochemical/molecular background of main diseases; -biochemistry of liver, kidney, muscles, brain; -biochemical background of detoxification of xenobiotics (including drugs); -contemporary biochemical-medical background of nutrition.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this human-organism targeted course is to provide students with basic knowledge of contemporary Medical Biochemistry and develop biochemical-clinical thinking, which are required: a) for understanding of molecular mechanism of human organism functioning and development of diseases; b) for systemic acquiring of new scientific conceptions needed for evidence based medicine; c) for using the Medical Biochemistry experience and knowledge in hospital practice.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Medical biochemistry is taught to medical students in accordance to the programme. The main objective of this course is to master analytical and systemic biochemical-medical way of thinking  with the help of problem-based assignments. This means that the students have to manage all the basic knowledge studied (not mechanically memorized!) throughout the course gradually integrate into logical analysis of both fundamental and clinical problems.
The student who graduated the course:
- orientates in medical biochemical terminology, can describe human key-metabolites/key-complexes functions and relationships with development of disorders/diseases;
 - possesses systemic knowledge about medical (human organism) biochemistry, human body metabolism, main disorders of metabolism, biochemical-medical integration of  tissues and organs, human body metabolism-based nutrition;
-  can analyze applying of biochemical-medical knowledge into every day practical work.
