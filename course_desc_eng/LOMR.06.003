Specific staining methods for cells and cell organelles. Different cell types. Analysis of cellular processes (mitosis, meiosis, cell death).Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main aim of the course is to enable participants to gain experience in the basic research methods and apparatus used in cell biology and to learn how to correctly document the results of practical work.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the course students: - knows different types and working principle of the light microscopes; can handle a simpler light microscope; can prepare and observe microscope slides - knows the principle of transmission electron microscopy and recognizes different cell structures in electron microscopic images - has an idea of working with animal cell cultures; can distinguish basic cell types and describe cell culture status (cell survival, cell density, contamination) - knows basic methods for determining cell viability - is able to determine the number of cells in a tissue culture dish using a hematocytometer - knows principal cell fixation and staining methodologies - knows the working principle of flow cytometry; understands results on different graphs and is able to analyze the results detecting apoptotic cells as an example - knows how to correctly document the results of practical work (laboratory diary) and is able to assess its necessity.
