Overview of human embryonic development, general structural principles of tissues and microscopic structure of organs is given. Particular attention is paid to the structures of oral cavity. During practical classes basic types of tissue and characteristics of tissues and organs are studied by means of examination of histological slides.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course of histology aims to provide students with an understanding of the microscopic structure and development of cells tissues and organs, with emphasis in the correlation between structure and function. Special attention is paid to the structures of oral cavity, in particular to the structure and development of teeth.  The course provides a practical experience in the examination of histological slides and gives the basis of understanding of normal tissue and organ structure, which is essential in further studies in order to understand the pathological changes in the human body produced by various diseases.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the end of the course, the student should be able to:  1. Understand the essence of the steps in the preparation of histological specimens and efficiently use microscope to study histological slides 2. Describe the stages of the early human embryonic development, embryogenesis of tissues and organs, and understand the causes of malformations. 3. Describe the structural characteristics of the basic tissue types and relate functional capabilities of each tissue type with their structure 4. Understand the basic principles of organ construction 5. Define and describe the histological characteristics of normal organs and relate the structure of organs and organ systems with the function.
