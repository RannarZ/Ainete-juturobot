The aim of the course is to give a general overview of the principles and methods of monitoring the environment. The following will be addressed: environmental monitoring objectives, methods, parameters; measuring instruments; basic contact monitoring, and remote sensing technologies. The graduate has practical experience in the use of basic monitoring methods and has become acquainted with different types of monitoring through various presentations and demonstrations. The course provides an opportunity to practice real work techniques as an environmental specialist or analyst. The internship takes place partly in cooperation with professional organizations outside the university.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to give the student experience of project-based practice in using the basic methods of environmental monitoring, to introduce the basic concepts related to the field, to practice the basic techniques of an environmental monitoring specialist, and to provide practical sampling and environmental monitoring experience.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student who has completed the course:  - knows the main objectives of environmental monitoring and national monitoring obligations and requirements arising from European Union legislation - knows what environmental monitoring is and knows the basic methods of environmental monitoring in atmospheric, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere monitoring - knows the main parameters measured and recorded by environmental monitoring - knows the types and methods of basic environmental observations and sampling - knows how to correctly collect, process and store observational data and analyze the results. - has an overview of the types, uses and basic principles of remote sensing and contact monitoring - knows basic measuring instruments - can through practical experience correctly take environmental samples, e.g. water, gas, soil, plant biomass samples according to the parameters to be determined - is able to analyze how the experience and knowledge gained during the internship has supplemented his / her university education - is able to perform self-analysis on the basis of practical experience, which allows the student to interpret the gained practical experience - can work in a team.
