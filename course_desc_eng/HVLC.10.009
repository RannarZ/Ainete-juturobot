Communication science is threefold: (1) writing a research article in English for publication in your discipline; (2) communicating your research orally to a scientific audience at, for example, science conferences, and/or communicating your research orally to non-science audiences (think about formats such as TED speeches or presentations to high school students); (3) writing non-scientific texts about your research, i.e. texts that popularises your science or discipline (think about formats such as Novaator articles or Wikipedia articles or blog posts or newspaper articles or the popular science chapter of your thesis).

1.	Scientific writing: 

The course increases your writing skills of scientific and professional genres. This section of the course provides you with opportunities to apply these skills in the process of writing a full academic paper and to receive ample feedback from your peers and the instructor. By the end of the course you should have a complete draft (more or less) ready for submission. 

2.	Presenting science: 

The course increases your presentation skills of scientific and professional genres. This section of the course provides you with opportunities to apply these skills in the process of presenting a full academic presentation and to receive ample feedback from your peers and the instructor. By the end of the course you should have a presentation (more or less) ready for a conference. 

3.	Popular science: 

The course increases your presentation skills of scientific and professional genres. This section of the course provides you with opportunities to apply these skills in the process of writing a popular science article and present a popular science presentation and to receive ample feedback from your peers and the instructor. By the end of the course you should have an article and a presentation (more or less) ready.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The three components share common objectives:
-	Students can recognise and translate productive writing strategies.
-	Students can apply these productive writing strategies to match their personal identity as writers.
-	Students can choose which of these strategies are most suitable for them throughout their career as PhD students and future researchers. 
-	Students practice the art of writing their research to a variety of genres
-	Students practice the art of communicating their research in a variety of genres
-	Students can write, revise, rewrite, and synthesise, their research logically and concisely. 
-	Students can design a logical outline of a story exemplifying their research using different strategies of storytelling
-	Students can choose and use different technical tools that supports the communication of their science

PART A: Scientific Writing
-	Identify and critically evaluate different rhetorical devices in journal articles
-	Write and revise their draft for different rhetorical devices. 
-	Review drafts of journal articles and give and take constructive feedback to learn and revise their own text
-	Draft an effective cover letter stipulating the needs of their draft journal article
-	Develop a full academic paper through various revision loops, including online and face-to-face peer review 

PART B: presenting and popular science
-	Communicate simply their scientific research
-	Communicate an interesting conference presentation
-	Develop your own voice to appear in a confident manner in front of audiences
-	Capture and captivate an audience
-	Choose various modes of technical tools to aid the communication processLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The students who have passed the course: PART A - can diagnose their own writing process and writing techniques, and experiment with this process to best suit their personal writing needs, and develop as scientific writers; - can understand writing requirements for their discipline and specific journal requirements; - can improve their text to be more scientific, formal, informal, and can communicate their message to different target groups;  - have developed their skills to critically analyse and give feedback to written and oral texts; - can receive and integrate feedback; PART B - are familiar with the principles of (conference) abstract writing; - know how to organise an academic presentation and are aware of how it differs from other oral genres intended for wider audiences; - know how to adequately answer questions from the audience; - are aware of language-specific requirements for writing and communication. - can start and finish a presentation effectively - can select strategies based on audience  - can use storytelling techniques to present
