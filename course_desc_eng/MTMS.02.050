The course includes material from probability theory and mathematical statistics which covers mathematical basis for higher level courses on data analysis.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give knowledge and experience in probability and statistics, which enables to attend higher level courses on stochastic modeling in master studies.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the course a student - knows design of modern probability theory; - understand the entity of the hypothesis and are able to construct them in different situations; - know methods for the controlling the hypothesis in a case of the one parameter and in a case of the comparing two parameters; - have an overview of the regression and dispersion analysis; - are able to derive the confidence intervals for parameters (and their difference) for the normal, binomial and relative distributions; - are able to apply the theory for the deriving estimates, confidence intervals and for the controlling hypothesis for the parameters of the regression and dispersion analysis with one explanatory variable.
