The class practices solving problem tasks, finding data in the text, and compiling formulas based on the text. The creation of definitions based on the concepts of classical genetics as well as randomly selected objects, phenomena and connections is practised.

Text assignments are based on classical genetics on the following topics: mono- and dihybrid crossing; genes interaction; X-chromosome linked characteristics; linked genes; varied tasks, and genetic determination of cat hair colour.

It is necessary to assess the genes of colour and pattern of the cat's coat for ten cats. This task is used to study gene interactions and to learn exclusion techniques. 

In the class, sample tasks are solved. Basic learning takes place independently at home, solving tasks from the collection of "Geneetika 체lesanded" and e-tests. An e-test has been compiled for each topic in Moodle. The results of each e-test must be 100 % correct. The test can be performed as many times and for as long as is necessary to reach 100% before the deadline. E-tests are for studying and recording what has had heard in class.

To pass the exam, it is necessary to perform all e-tests and determine the genotype of 10 cats independently. The final grade is the grade of the exam.Objectives/eesm채rkid:  To develop problem tasks based on classical genetics. To develop functional reading and apply mathematics to solve problem tasks.Learning outcomes/천piv채ljund:  The ability to solve problem tasks increases, the use of mathematics in solving problem tasks increases, and the understanding of the concepts of classical genetics become more established. The ability to define phenomena and their connections is improved.
