Newest disputable scientific problems,  related to the atmospheric research topics of the  Institute of  Physics (atmospheric dynamics, aerosols, atmospheric electricity, radiative transfer, marine physics, atmospheric pollution dispersion, ionizing radiation, remote sensing ), are discussed on the basis of the recent scientific publications. Participation and oral presentations (at least twice during masters studies) are compulsory.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The purpose of the seminar is to give students an experience of working through scientific information and presenting it in an oral presentation, exchange information about the development of research. 
Another aim of the seminar is to broaden the students' understanding of various topics in environmental physics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  student acquires - an experience in working through scientific information and preparing it for presentation in a logical manner, - an experience in giving an oral presentation using computer slides or blackboard, - the broader view of a range of current problems in environmental physics.
