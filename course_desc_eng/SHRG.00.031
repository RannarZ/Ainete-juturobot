The course introduces the peculiarities and types of oral and written self-expression. The written self-expression focuses on scholarly texts. The oral self-expression deals with both, individual public speech as well as public debate (parliamentary debate). Students will learn how to develop and structure a text (both oral and written). The course will develop students' argumentation and contra argumentation skills. The course offers also an introduction into demagogy and provides hints on how to overcome it if one faces them in a discussion/debate. Students will get suggestions how to improve their public speaking skills in order to make speaking more efficient, as well as they will learn about the importance of body and paralanguage (non-verbal self-expression). Students will prepare several assignments through which they will learn how to draw up a well-argued and coherent written text. In addition, students will participate in a video training and a mini debate tournament.Objectives/eesmärkid:  - to develop students' knowledge of Estonian grammar and writing in Estonian, in particular working with scholarly texts; - to develop oral expression skills, including both individual public speech as well as public debate; - to familiarise with the main language reference resources and teach how to use them.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students who have successfully passed the course: - are able to compose concise motivation letter; - are able to analyse scholarly text and summarise it properly; - are able to assess the quality of scholarly texts written by other students and edit them if necessary; - are able to express their thoughts in a clear, grammatically and stylistically correct manner; - have knowledge of developing a public speech (inc. non-verbal self-expression) and are able to deliver the speech;  - know how to develop argumentation to defend their point of view and are able to defend it in a public debate; - recognise and react properly to demagoguery;  - are able to assess critically their written and oral expression skills and are able to find solutions to overcoming occurring weaknesses regarding these skills.
