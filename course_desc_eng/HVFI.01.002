The aim of the course is to provide participants with an overview of the key issues of research integrity: making decisions about the authorship of a scientific publication in multi-author publications, obtaining informed consent, processing data, ensuring the protection of privacy and personal data of the subjects involved in the study, obtaining necessary permissions, consents and ethics committee approvals for research and understanding their meaning. The entire course is supported by an e-learning environment that brings together materials that are relevant to different fields of science. From them, the doctoral student chooses 6 EAP worth of assignments. The course is structured in such a way that doctoral students can choose topics and tasks appropriate for their specialty and specifics of research there. The course also includes seminars where doctoral students from different disciplines can experience disciplinary differences in interpreting the Code of Conduct for Research Integrity.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Science is a collective activity based on trust. To ensure credibility, researchers should understand their responsibility. This presupposes that researchers know ethical principles and are capable to notice moral choices in scientific research and to make reasoned decisions. On November 1st, 2017, the University of Tartu together with 20 other Estonian research institutions, the Estonian Research Council, and the Ministry of Education and Research signed the Estonian Code of Conduct for Research Integrity Agreement https://www.eetika.ee/et/estonian-code-conduct-research-integrity. The course gives all doctoral students of the University of Tartu an opportunity to learn in depth about the values and principles of action that underlie research integrity. The course addresses all aspects of research - from the research planning and conduct of research, to the publication of results and their societal application. It also discusses the relationship between the researcher and society and the various roles of the researcher, such as lecturer, supervisor, reviewer, expert, and cooperation partner, as well as dilemmas arising from these roles.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The doctoral student who has completed the course has an overview of the values and principles of action that underpin the Code of Conduct for Research Integrity and is capable of identifying occasions when ethical consideration is required in research practice. The student who has completed the course is able to participate in interdisciplinary teamwork, is capable to analyze cases and to reflect critically upon and weigh arguments used in respective analyses. The student is able to recognize his/her attitudes concerning research integrity; the student has expressed his/her views both orally and in writing, has submitted a written assignment that satisfies the course requirements, and is able to make reasoned moral decisions.
