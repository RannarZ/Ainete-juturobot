grade
* Operation of circuits, DC and AC theory of general principles;
* Basics of digital electronics;
* analog and digital electronics used in electronic components (transformer, diode, transistor, operational amplifier, etc.) Purpose and principles of operation;
* Optoelectronics (photocell, photodiode, etc.) operating principles;
* electromechanical devices (relays, motors, generators, etc.), And uses principles of operation;
* electrical parameters (power, input and output impedance, etc.) In the interconnection of different devices;
* non-electrical quantities (light, pH, temperature, magnetic field, etc.) used to measure the operating principles of sensors;
* electrical safety.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course  is to provide undergraduate science students a basic knowledge of electricity and magnetism, bringing together within a single course inelectrical engineering, electric measurements, electric circuit theory, analogelectronics, and digital electronics basics. The course consists of theoretical lectures and practical value of the holding of practical classes.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Course graduates will be able to independently use the modern equipment used in laboratories, without hurting him/herself  or a device itself. The student also van continue his studies of electronics in some sophisticated electronics course. This is done by the student knowledge:
* Operation of circuits, DC and AC theory of general principles;
* Basics of digital electronics;
* analog and digital electronics used in electronic components (transformer, diode, transistor, operational amplifier, etc.) Purpose and principles of operation;
* Optoelectronics (photocell, photodiode, etc.) operating principles;
* electromechanical devices (relays, motors, generators, etc.), And uses principles of operation;
* electrical parameters (power, input and output impedance, etc.) In the interconnection of different devices;
* non-electrical quantities (light, pH, temperature, magnetic field, etc.) used to measure the operating principles of sensors;
