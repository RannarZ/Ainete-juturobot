The course gives an overview of the techniques of big data analysis in biogeochemical cycles at ecosystem and landscape level (e.g. data analysis derived from eddy covariance method used for greenhouse gas investigations, analysis of data from modern techniques used for the investigations of microorganisms controlling carbon and nutrient cycling in soils), and includes several hands-on exercises. The course provides students with skills necessary to investigate patterns of biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems and landscapes.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to provide overview and understanding of the main techniques for big data analysis used in landscape biogeochemical studies. The course provides students with skills necessary to investigate main biogeochemical cycles in ecosystem and landscape level studies.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A successful student has a systematic overview of the main ideas of big data analysis and main methods used in landscape, including ecosystem studies. Student has practical experience of solving big data analysis tasks by means of the common software packages of statistical data analysis.
