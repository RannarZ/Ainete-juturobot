The lecture course presents the principles of the physics of irreversible processes, linear response and fluctuations, the foundations of physical kinetics and the various models of phase transitions and critical phenomena.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to present the basic principles of the physics of non-equilibrium macroscopic systems and phase transitions and critical phenomena.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of the course, the student: - knows the basic principles for the description of irreversible processes; - knows the quantum statistical theory of linear response; - understands the role of fluctuations and fluctuation-dissipation theorem in statistical physics; - can interpret the Boltzmann kinetic equation and is able to apply it in the various physical situations; - knows the phenomenological theory of the first and second order phase transitions; - knows the various models of orderings.
