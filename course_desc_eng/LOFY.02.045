An introductory overview will be given, related to the fabrication methods of nanoelectronic device components including the classification of their constituent materials and substrates as well as the roadmaps before the development and scale-up of industrial device production. Problems related to the choice of suitable materials, methods of synthesis of materials an precursor chemistry will be described. Role of the substrate and surface reactions in the formation of nanostructures will be treated, in conjunction with the process-related physical and chemical quality of the devices. The audience will be introduced to the principles of the electrical characterization of device prototypes, underlining the importance of conduction, leakage currents, capacitance as well as interrelationships between electronic charge trap densities, composition and processing history of the materials analysed. Connections between fundamental and application-oriented studies or between research and development will be highlighted.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The purpose of the lecture course is to introduce the master and postgraduate students to the technology and measurements of thin solid films as the basis of nanoelectronics. Nanodimensional devices, such as contemporary and future transistors as well as dynamic and non-volatile memory concepts, will be described together with the basics of their electronic characterization.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon the completion of the course the participants will become educated in the following: 1) They will be familiar with the working principles of contemporary and advanced nanoelectronic devices, such as three-dimensional memory cells and transistors, flash memories, phase change memories, nanosensorics. 2) They will be introduced to the the main fabrication methods and configurations of the nanoelectronic devices. 3) They will have knowledge concerning the constituent materials of the devices as well as the material analysis methods. 4) They will know the concepts and possibilities of the development of industrially relevant devices based on nanorods, nanotubes, nanodots, graphene.
