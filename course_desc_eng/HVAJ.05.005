The course will provide an overview of the diversity and contradictory nature of the art history of the Baroque period. It will deal with the influence and hybridisation of various styles, and highlight the differences between the works of art from various centres and countries.  Along with the Classicism engendered by Andrea Palladio and its repercussions, the course also examines Roman Baroque and its reflections in Bohemian and Bavarian architecture, French Rationalism as the basis for the architectural language that developed in the 17th century, and the development of Rococo piquancy, as well as the Picturesque and Sublime in England. At the level of fine arts, the main emphasis is on the period between Mannerism and Romanticism, with attention focused on contradictory trends and individual themes: the differences between Caravaggio and the Caraccis; Flemish and Dutch painting; the Enlightenment and the Empire; the universal language of Classicism and the diverse art rhetoric of the 19th-century styles. Simultaneously with the top events in Europe, facts and issues related to the closer vicinity  - the art history of Estonia, the Baltics and Scandinavia - are also presented.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course provides an overview of the most important trends in European art history from the 16th to the 19th century.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student that completes the course:  - will have an overview of Western European art from the late Baroque to Impressionism;  - will be familiar with the work of the most outstanding artists and architects of the period;  - in addition to understanding the art, will also be able to speak and write about it.
