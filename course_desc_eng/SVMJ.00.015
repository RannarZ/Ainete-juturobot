Students can practice in different companies and organizations (ministries, agencies, local governments, banks, universities, OÜ, NGOs, etc.), set up their own company, participate in research groups or participate in projects. The student chooses the type of internship according to his / her developmental needs and outcomes of the curriculum. The internship supervisors are the internship coordinator at the university and a supervisor from the company / oraganisation side.
During the internship, the student has to follow the tasks set in Moodle. One of the essential outcomes of the internship is the student's self-analysis, in which he/she identifies what he/she has learned, his/her strengths and weaknesses, and the feedback of the supervisor (organization) to his/her activities.
