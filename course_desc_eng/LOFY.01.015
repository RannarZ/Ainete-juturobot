The lectures prior practical works will introduce the fundamentals of the nuclear physics, e.g. nuclear periodic system, nuclear models, nuclear decay, nuclear reactions as well interaction of ionizing radiation and matter. Units for measuring radiation are learned. 
In practical works, skills on using experimental techniques for ionizing radiation detection will be obtained, theoretical knowledge on ionizing radiation and its properties will be deepened. Geiger-Muller tube, scintillation and semiconductor detectors are used for detecting different types of ionizing radiation (alpha, beta or gamma). Ionization power and penetration strength of different types of ionizing radiation as well thermo-luminescence effect, Poisson distribution and interaction of radiation and matter will be studied.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to teach fundamentals of nuclear physics, to learn the main detection methods and detector types for ionizing radiation, to learn interaction processes between ionizing radiation and matter, to teach the students how to use experimental techniques for detecting different types of ionizing radiation.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student, obtained positive result on course: * Is familiar with fundamentals of nuclear physics * Is familiar with main sources of ionizing radiation and their characteristics * Has obtained knowledge about main types of detectors for the ionizing radiation and main interactions between radiation and detector media. * Is capable to apply various types of detectors in measurements of the ionizing radiation * Is capable to work with nuclear physics experimetal technique * Is capable to analyse obtained experiemental results * Is capable to explain obtained experimental results and the essens of the experiments
