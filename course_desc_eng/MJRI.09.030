The course introduces mathematical methods (matrix algebra, differential and integral calculus, optimisation, differential and difference equations, phase diagrams) used in models of economics and knowing of which is needed for understanding of economics textbooks and scientific articles. Mathematical methods considered are illustrated with the examples form economics covering statics, comparative statics and dynamics. The aim of the course is not a perfect analysis and interpretation of models used as an example, the latter will be the topic of further courses.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course advances student's skills and knowledge about different mathematical methods, illustrating them with the help of applications in economicsLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student, who has passed the course * knows different, both simple and more complex, mathematical methods; (differentiating, integrating, optimizing, matrix algebra, difference equations, differential equations, phase diagrams; statics, comparative statics, dynamics); * understands the essence of different methods; * is able to see possibilities to use these methods for analysing different models; * is able to choose an appropriate mathematical method for analysing the model and to use this method; * is able to interpret the results of the analysis.
