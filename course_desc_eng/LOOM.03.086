The course concentrates to the spherical build-up of the planet earth, its gravity and magnetic fields, and geophysical methods in studies of the earth's interior. Principles of plate tectonics, hot spots and supercontinents will be presented. The course includes the following topics:

1. Introduction. Overview of methods that are used in studying the Earth's interior.
2. Gravity field. Earth's mass and density; linkage between gravity and geology; density and porosity of geological material; measurements of gravity; gravity in different tectonical situations.
3. Magnetic field, its variations; instruments to measure the magnetic field, rock magnetic properties, magnetic fields associating with geological structures; basis of paleogeography.
4. Seismology. Stress and deformation,; elastic properties; seismic waves, their behavior in layered environments; earthquakes, registration and description; earthquakes in describing the Earth' interior.
5. Thermal field, sources of heat; density of the heat flow; melted regions within the solid Earth.
6. Structure of the Earth. Earth crust, types and composition of the crust; mantle, core, and processes within.
7. Plate tectonics. Geological processes at boundaries of neighboring plates.
8. Hot spots; mantle convection; forces that influence the plate movements, supercontinents.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Scope of the course is to introduce physical fields and spherical build-up of the planet earth, plate tectonics, and the methods used in studing the interior of earth.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student has knowledge on spherical structure of earth and principles of plate tectonics, plate-marginal processes and relations to hot spot magnetism. In addition, student has basic knowledge on principles of seismology, gravimetry, magnetometry, and thermometry.
