Finally, the Master's Thesis aims to prepare students for further research, study or professional careers through the development of their skills in data collection and analysis, use of original sources and the conducting and writing up of a detailed research project.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Defended MA thesis confirms that student is able - to devise a realistic programme of research into a topic; - to collect, select and review relevant background literature; - to identify and gather research data (i.e. from original language sources, memoirs, interviews, the media, archives, government reports); - to understand and select the appropriate methodology for dealing with sources and data; - to apply these methods (e.g. historical analysis, content analysis, discourse analysis, questionnaires, interviews, participant observation); - to organise the data collected and analyse your findings; - to write up an original research report, present research methodology and findings/results to academic and professional audience; - to be self-critical about your findings and the limitations of your analysis.
