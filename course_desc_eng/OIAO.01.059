The course aims to teach students basic knowledge of psychology, sociology and social science research methods. The course begins with an introduction to individual human behaviour and the processes and factors that shape it. This is followed by information on the functioning of society and how its processes, institutions, structures and norms regulate people's lives. The link between the field of psychology and sociology and the law is an essential element of the whole course. The course will address issues such as how knowledge of psychology is helpful to the legal professional, how the law regulates processes in society, and how the law reflects society's morals and values. How to distinguish between scientifically proven knowledge and urban legends, stereotypes, and myths is an essential part of the course. To this end, students will be introduced to social science research methods.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim is to develop the student's understanding of (1) the principles and variability of human behaviour; (2) how people act together as a society, social structures, and social development; (3) the role of law in regulating people's lives both as individuals and as members of society; (4) how to study individual and social behaviour.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student who has completed the course: Knows what (factors and processes) shape and influence human behaviour.
