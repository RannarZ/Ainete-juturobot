The lectures provide an overview of plant water relations, mineral nutrition, photosynthesis, respiration, growth and development, and interaction of these processes with ambient environment at an organismic level of organization.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Acquire an overview of plant water relations, mineral nutrition, photosynthesis, respiration, growth and development, and interaction of these processes with ambient environment at an organismic level of organization.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who passed the course: 1. Is able to explain plant anatomical, morphological and chemical composition specifities as adaptation to perform photosynthesis, water metabolism and mineral nutrition.  2. Is able to explain water metabolism on basis of water potential concept; 3. Understands how C3, C4 and CAM plants use light  to produce carbohydrates from water and carbon dioxide;  4. Knows essential soil mineral elements, his absorption and membrane transport specifities. Is able to compose the plant mineral nutrition solution, 5. Is able to describe the formation of plant morphology and anatomical structure during embryogenesis and germination and the role of phytochrome and cryptochrome in photomorphogenesis; 6. Is able to characterise some main plant physiology methods (water potential and photosynthesis estimation, the chromatography of photosynthesis pigments and phenolic compounds); 7.Is able to carry out mathematical calculations connected with photosynthesis, water metabolism and membrane transport.
