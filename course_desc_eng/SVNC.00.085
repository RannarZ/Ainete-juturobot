The course includes:
1) Supervised instruction (parametric / non-parametric algorithms, machine's support vector , cores, neural networks).
2) Non-supervised learning (clustering, dimensional reduction, recommendation system, in-depth training).
3) Best practice in machine learning (bias-variance theory, innovation process in machine learning and artificial intelligence).
The course also relies on a number of sample-case solutions and applications, so that the student learns how to implement machine learning algorithms for building smart robots (perception, control), understanding the text (web search, spam), computer vision, data mining and other areas.Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining and statistical pattern recognition.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Within this course, students learn the most effective machine learning methods and can practice their independent deployment and recruitment. They also learn how to apply these methods quickly and skillfully to solve new problems.
