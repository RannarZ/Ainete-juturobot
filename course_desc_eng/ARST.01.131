The main functions of the maxillofacial system are suction, deglutition, chewing, breathing, speech and mimics. If those functions do not work properly, then the growth of maxillofacial system will also be disturbed. The sooner we discover and treat the faulty function, the smaller amount of damage will linger.
Since the earliest children are being brought to the orthodontist appointment at the age of 7 or 8, orthodontists get a chance to diagnose a function disorder too late. Most of the children visit an orthodontist for the first time at the age of 11-13. If you discover a proper function anomaly only at the teenage years, then treating this problem at this age is more difficult than when a child is 1-3 years old.
Treatment of function disorders is a teamwork. It is good to notice a functional disorder as early as possible. Then we can help a child more efficiently. Most importantly, then we have a chance to prevent the generation of big health concerns that in the future may become costly and time-consuming for the family as well as the society.
Numbers of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are not followed up to secure normal breathing pattern post adenotonsillectomy (AT). Children with OSA end up in our clinic too late. The optimal window to first investigate the tendencies is a 2-3 year of life to look for signs of OSA. Currently, the average age is around 7-10 years, when we first see our patients in the clinic. Estonia has a well-running daycare centre system. About 90% children attend these centres. There are as well speech therapists in every daycare centre. Our long-time target is to teach the daycare centre personnel together with a local speech therapist to point out those children, who are continuous mouth breathers, to advice parents to seek help.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course is giving an overview of orofacial normal functions and dysfunctions; about aetiology, prevention and treatment principles in a multidisciplinary team.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Participants will: - Be able to identify and recognise orofacial dysfunction - Learn the role played by myofunctional therapy in treatment success - Be able to evaluate need of treatment - Be able to understand work principles of multidisciplinary team
