This course provides students with basic knowlegde of contemporary Medical Biochemistry and develop biochemical-clinical thinking. The following problems are highlighted: a) basic biomolecules of human body (their structure an biofunctions); e) vitamins and hormones and human organism (including science-based analysis of medical preparations of vitamins); c) overview of metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids; d) biochemical background of detoxification of xenobiotics (including drugs); c) science-based analysis of role of human nutrients and principles of nutrition.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Primary aims of this course: a) To give an updated discussion of the selected and in practical work relevant knowledge about human body biomolecules and the metabolic events, underlying the specific functions of cells of the human body and disorders. b) To give an updated and human body oriented biochemical basis of medicinal products containing of vitamins and/or minerals and cosmetics, food additives and analyse pharmaceutically important aspects of nutrition. c) To develop biochemical-pharmaceutical thinking and to create the basis for using the biochemical experience in the practice of the future and to guarantee the systemic acquiring of new scientific conceptions in the field of biochemistry.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who graduated the course should mastered: a) the selected and in practical work relevant knowledge about human body biomolecules and the metabolic events, underlying the specific functions of cells of the human body and disorders; b) human body oriented selected and in practical work relevant knowledge and biochemical basis of preparation of vitamins, minerals and cosmetics, food additives and pharmaceutically important aspects of nutrition; c) principles of biochemical-pharmaceutical thinking for creating the basis for using the biochemical experience in the practice of the future and to guarantee the systemic acquiring  of  new scientific conceptions.
