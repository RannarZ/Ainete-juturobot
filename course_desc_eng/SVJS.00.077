The course introduces the political studies realm from the perspective of its three disciplines - comparative politics, public administration and international relations. The course is organized in three parts:
1) government and politics as a study path focuses on self-directed and informed choices regarding the personal planning of studies based on formal information of the study and curriculums as well as on the data, examples of the related choices made by earlier students of government and politics, and study materials covering three disciplines of political studies;
2) government and politics as science (scientific path) introduces the research projects, research-based career paths based on projects and scholars of the Johan Skytte Institute of Political Studies, and study materials covering scientific research in three disciplines of political studies;
3) government and politics as a career path deals with the theme "professional jobs" related to the academic discipline on the basis of career choices and paths of recent alumni of this discipline, who graduated the curriculum from 2 to 5 years earlier).Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course enhances the skills of self-directed planning and decision-making, introduces the alternative paths and choices in the curriculum, top level scientific research in government and politics, career prospects outside of university. The aim of this course is to introduce the discipline of government and politics (public administration, international relations and comparative politics) from three dimensions: the disciplinary trajectory of studies; the disciplinary trajectory of science; the disciplinary trajectory of career in labor market. All three dimensions are tackled on the basis of academic course materials and the pragmatic choices and practical considerations of earlier students and the alumni (including scholars, researchers, civil servants etc.). Being informed about the choices and considerations of previous students allows first-year students of government and politics to make more informed self-directed choices in their own trajectories of study, research and career.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student who completes the course successfully is: - informed about the choices and practical considerations of students of government and politics in three dimensions: academic discipline as a study, academic discipline as science, academic discipline as a career (in labor market); - capable of personally forming self-directed choices in three dimensions - academic discipline as a study, academic discipline as science, academic discipline as a career (in labor market); - able to plan autonomously and in a self-directed manner her/his paths of studies and of career.
