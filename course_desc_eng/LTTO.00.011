This introductory course is meant for students interested in space technology and space research. The course gives and overview of the history of space exploration in the World and in Estonia, as well as future perspectives. Most important space technology components, instruments and their work principles are presented. Both peaceful and military use of space applications are discussed. During the course, students will design their own mission.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aims of the course are: - to raise the competence of Estonian industry and scientific institutes in the field of space technology by introducing this topic to the future workforce; - to explain and popularize the field of space research, European Space Agency space programmes and the role of Estonian membership.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  At the end of the course the participants will be able to: - recall the capabilities of Tartu Observatory Space Technology Department/Labs - describe the different opportunities to continue on in the space field in Estonia and ESA - explain why we should do space research - describe how Estonia fits into the space race - design a space mission collaboratively - create value as a team member - collaboratively develop a solution based on requirements - describe the usefulness of ECSS and standards in general - identify and describe satellite subsystems - identify and describe space mission phases - relate new knowledge to past experience - recall the fundamental physical concepts governing missions in space - make logical guesses with limited knowledge - analyse space missions and critique them on a basic level
