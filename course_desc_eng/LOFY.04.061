The lecture course gives an exposition of classical relativistic fields in flat space-time, considering the real and complex Klein-Gordon field, the Maxwell and Yang-Mills fields and the Dirac field. The derivation of the equations of motion from the action principle and finding their solutions, describing the various symmetry properies of fields and the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking finally leads to the complete Lagrangian of the standard model of elementary particles. The last part of the course introduces soliton and instanton solutions. .Objectives/eesmärkid:  The puropse of the course is to give an introduction to modern field theory and explain the contents of the Standard Model of elementary particles.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing the course a student + knows the basics of Lie groups (axioms, representations, generators, algebra, Casimir operators) and the reperesentations of orthogonal, unitary, Lorentz, and Poincare groups; + understands the principles of constructing actions for relativistic fields, can derive from an action the equations of motion and conserved quantities, as well as to determine the dimensions of fields and constants in the action, also sketch the interactions encoded in the action; + knows all the fields, parameters and interactions described by the Standard Model, including the Higgs mechanism.
