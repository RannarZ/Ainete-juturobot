This is not a 'fact-oriented' exam, where students are tested to see if they can recite what author X said in chapter 3 or author Y in article 4. Rather, it's about demonstrating a level of maturity concerning the field and being able to compare and synthesize material in a free and open intellectual exchange. Students should view the exam as a way of establishing for themselves a lasting feeling of familiarity with their discipline, as well as an opportunity to strategically develop different scholarly profiles, which will help them both in their dissertation work as well as future teaching activities. This is the chance to master important aspects of the field in order to prepare oneself both for research and a professional career.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to help a PhD student obtain deep theoretical and empirical knowledge relevant for their PhD dissertation in the field of governance and digital transformation.
