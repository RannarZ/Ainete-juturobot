Literary works from Estonian and world literature will be read and compared. The focus is on early 20th century literature, the "Young-Estonian" era, when Estonian literature was more involved than ever before in consciously modernizing world literature, trying to capture its aesthetic and worldview nerve. Borrowing itself, a conscious will to adapt, not a naive, imitative or epigonal relationship with other literatures, is one of the main features of literary modernism.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The seminar addresses one selected literary phenomenon from a comparative perspective, applying the methods of comparative literature. The aim of the course is to develop an understanding of the transnational distribution of literary phenomena, the fundamental borrowing character of literature as "a factor accelerating the immanent evolution of literature" (J. Lotman). The concept, based on a dynamic concept of culture instead of an essentialistic one, sees borrowing as an opportunity to enrich culture, an opportunity for evolution at all.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student (close) reads and analyzes literary works selected for the course; compares them using the perspective and methods of comparative literature; operates with stylistic, fluid and thought concepts;  participates in and conducts a discussion in the classroom;   writes comparative analysis on a selected topic.
