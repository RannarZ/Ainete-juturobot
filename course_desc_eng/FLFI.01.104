Occidental metaphysical tradition. The course focuses on those representatives of the tradition who were not studied in the prerequisite course. Central to the course is the study of texts of the philosophers themselves. Thus one goal of the course is to cultivate the students' primary skills of textual analysis.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  On successful completion of the course, the student is familiar with the problems and solutions, main concepts and ways of arguing in the philosophical doctrines considered, and is able to link these to their historical-cultural context and earlier philosophical tradition. In addition, the student is able to analyze philosophical texts from Ancient and Early Modern periods, and to reconstruct the authors' lines of argumentation.
