The course of "Biology" (8.0 ECTS) gives students an understanding, basic knowledge and skills in modern biology.
Lectures have following topics: modern cell biology and molecular biology, biology of development, genetics, theory of evolution and human ecology.
Practicals have following topics: modern cell biology and biology of development, genetics and cytogenetics, human ecology.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the subject is to give students of first year an overview in modern biology. The course is focused on molecular biology and genetics and has medical and applied orientation. The aim of the subject is to give students of first year an overview in modern biology. The course is focused on molecular biology and genetics and has medical and applied orientation.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  As a result of successful passing this course the student knows the basic concepts of all main
branches of modern human biology (cell and molecular biology, genetics, biology of development, evolutionary biology and human ecology) and their applications in medicine, and is able to use this knowledge for understanding and solving practical problems.

After passing the cell biology and molecular biology the student:
Comprehends the nature and mechanisms of replication, transcription and translation and their relations with the central functions of a eukaryotic cell.
Comprehends the structure and function of eukaryotic cell organelles and understands their relations with pathological processes.
Comprehends the major methods in molecular and cell biology and their usage in medicine.

After passing the genetics the student:
Knows the hierarchical system of material bases of inheritance and functional processes of heredity. Possesses principles of genetics and is able to use these in practice.
Knows main types of human hereditary diseases, principles of their classification and frequencies in populations.
Knows methods in human genetics.
Knows principles of population genetics, its basic law and is able to use these in practice.

After passing the developmental biology the student:
Knows mechanisms of mitosis, meiosis, oogenesis and spermatogenesis and their correlations with human pathological processes.
Knows processes and mechanisms typical for different periods of ontogenesis.
Is able to connect theoretical knowledge with morphological structures in normal development and in pathology.

After passing the evolutional biology and human ecology the student:
Knows types of theories of evolution, their roles and importance.
Knows principles of environmental protection and medical problems related with pollution of environment.
