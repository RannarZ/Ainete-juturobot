General topics: fermentation technologies, sustainable bioprocessing, bioprocessing for industrial production of chemicals, fuels and proteins; gas fermentation technologies, synthetic biology solutions for reaching biosustainability goals, biomass as a local resource, wood chemistry.
The course also provides insight into the contemporary use of synthetic biology tools for cell factories based on prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (bacteria, yeast, CHO cells, insect cells, algae, plants) in e.g. food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Manifold opportunities of anaerobic and aerobic production of biological compounds (metabolites, proteins, polymers, etc.) will be discussed and the major producing organisms and the technologies underlying their use and exploitation will be introduced. Also alternative methods for production of bio-based chemicals will be discussed (green chemistry).Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim is students to acquire knowledge of industrial applications of synthetic biology. The focus is given to pathways leading to anaerobic and aerobic production of industrially relevant compounds.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. describe the concepts behind different fermentation technologies and discuss advantages and disadvantages;
2. describe the synthesis and analysis strategies in synthetic biology;
3. navigate between the major producing organisms and technologies underlying their use.
