This lecture series will start with some basic forensic principles that underpin the use of analytical chemistry in the court room. It will then develop to cover key biological samples that can be encountered in a forensic investigation along with their specific uses and pre-cautions that need to be taken during collection, storage, analysis and reporting of these sample types. A significant amount of time will be devoted to understanding the ethical considerations around forensic analysis and how other regulation can affect an investigation. The final part of this series will focus on some future directions in food fraud detection using metabonomic profiling.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The overall objective of this course is to understand the forensic process and how it affects the analysis and reporting of the data obtained.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who passes the course:  --- understands the sample collection on the crime scene;  --- appreciates the chain of custody requirements; --- has knowledge of common forensic samples and specific issues with their retention;  --- understands the QA requirements in forensic analysis;  --- appreciates different regulatory requirements;  --- has an overview of the UK legal system;  --- understands the level of proof required for different cases,  --- understands why we need expert witnesses;  --- has knowledge of the different courts where the expert witness could appear;  --- understands the requirements of the expert witnesses' report.
