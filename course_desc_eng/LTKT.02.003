Advanced practical works in physical and colloidal chemistry. Selected practical problems in the fields of thermochemistry, phase transitions of pure substances, chemical equilibrium, properties of the electrolyte solutions, electrochemical applications, kinetics of chemical reactions, and of colloidal and surface chemistry will be solved.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main aim of the course is to give practical experience in handling of the basic equipment of physical chemistry.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  *Can distinguish important from unimportant information in relation to key ideas or themes from lectures.  *Independently is able to plan and establish the aim of the practical work. *Has relevant background knowledge in mathematics to describe processes and knows how to solve different problems. *Applies different mechanisms and experimental equipment and uses them effectively. *Is able to report the experimental results in writing form as well as verbally, interpret the results and make conclusions. *Works economically and according to safety regulations.
