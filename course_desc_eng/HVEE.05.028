During the course students work in pairs. Students with different native languages form language learning tandems where each member teaches the other their native language and learns the native language of their partner. One of the languages learned in the tandem must be Estonian, the other can be any other foreign language. The tandems are formed during the first meeting of the registered students, it is also possible to find one's own language learning partner and attend the course together. One member of the tandem is a native speaker of Estonian, the other member a native speaker of some other language. Each tandem makes their own individual study plan depending on their level of proficiency and language learning objectives. The contents and form of the learning will be determined collectively by the members of the tandem and the teacher. Language proficiency level sufficient to enable communication in the language to be learned is a prerequisite to attending the course. All tandems keep a study diary in Moodle where they must make a brief entry for each language class.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To improve the Estonian language skills of students who are not native speakers of Estonian and the foreign language skills of native speakers of Estonian in the language of their tandem partner.
