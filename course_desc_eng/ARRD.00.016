The subject is providing a general information about the common radiological methods, their diagnostic possibilities and limitations, indications and contraindications, referral and preparing of patients to examinations. The subject deals with strategy of the radiological examinations based on optimal use of the different radiological methods based on radiation dose. The knowledge about optimal planning of radiological investigation in suspected pathology in different organ systems based on radioprotection. The knowledge is provided about optimal choice of radiological investigations in  children and pregnant women. During the practical work the use and possibilities of modern picture archiving system is provided and teh knowledge is provided how to find main pathological finding on x ray and computed tomography imaging.Objectives/eesmärkid:  1.	The purpose of this subject is obtaining knowledge in diagnostic possibilities in different diagnostic methods.  2.	The aim is to obtain the knowledge about the risk in referring the  patients to the different radiological methods 3.	The aim is to obtain the knowledge about the radioprotection and radiation doses in different radiological methods escpeciallay  evaluating radiopreotection in childre, young adults and in  pregnant women.  4.	The aim is to obtain knowledge in optimal use of the different radiological methods based on radiation dose and the knowledge about optimal planning of radiological investigation in suspected pathology in different organ systems, in children and in pregnant woman based on radioprotection.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  1.	The student can provide the optimal investigation plan in different organ pathology  dependant in  radioprotection based on ALARA principle: As low as reasonably achievable).
2.	The student can provide the optimal investigation plan in different organ pathology  dependant how to most optimally and rapidly reach the diagnoosis.
3.	The student knows the indications and contraindications in different radiological investigations in different organ pathology. 
4.	The student knows how to write the request for radiological investigation to provide the most important information to do radiological investigation and to describe investigations. 
5.	The student knows the effective radiation dose in different x- ray, computed tomography , nuclear medicine and angiography investigations. 
6.	The student knows the risks in magnetic field and problems with referring the patient to the magnetic resonance tomography. 
7.	The student knows the principles of the optimal choice of radiological investigations in children and young adults dependent of radioprotection, contrast administration policy and other factors which can be harmful for the children.
8.	The student knows the principles of the optimal choice of radiological investigations in pregnant women dependant in radioprotection, contrast administration policy and other factors which can be harmful for the fetus. 
9.	The student knows the principles of the optimal choice of radiological investigations in patients with renal insufficience, diabetes and allergy and in other patients with  harmful effect of contrast media. 
10.	The student knows the risk factors, principles and preparations of interventional radiology procedures. 
11.	The student can based on the radiological report to find the changes in chest and sceletal x-ray, and head, chest and abdominal computed tomography 
12.	The student knows the principle of radiolprotection
13.	The student knows the principle of archiving images
