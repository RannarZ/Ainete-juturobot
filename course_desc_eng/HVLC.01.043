The course will examine the so-called Shakespeare Authoship Problem by looking at ten of his history plays: the eight plays of the Wars of the Roses cycle that covers the reigns of Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI, Edward IV and Richard III, plus King Lear and Macbeth which are particularly interesting for the author's personal concerns and preoccupations. For each session the student will have to read one play, the background material both about the authorship problem and the historical events dealt with in the play and its protagonists with the view of determining what liberties Shakespeare has taken with his material as it has come down to us. Each session will have a time set apart for discussion based on independent reading active participation in which is expected of each student. All the ten plays in the BBC version will also be watched in class. The course ends with a written exam paper written in class.
