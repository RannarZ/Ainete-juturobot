The first part of the subject provides an overview of the morphological system of the Russian language: it analyses Russian-language parts of speech, word formation, grammatical categories, functioning of parts of speech. The course deals with debatable (unsolved) issues of the modern morphology (the typology of parts of speech, the number of cases, the transition of parts of speech, etc.)  and with the changes happening in the modern morphological system. During the practical lessons students learn to define forms and means of expression of their grammatical meaning, to perform the morphological analysis word forms, to analyze the changes happening in the morphological system of the modern Russian language (the analyticity growth), to correct the morphological mistakes occurring in the speech of foreign students, and to explain the reasons for their occurrence.  
The second part of the subject provides an overview of the syntactical system of the course: it analyzes the types and means of syntactical connections in a word combination, in a simple and compound sentence as well as looks at the types of sentences in the Russian language. The course also analyses debatable issues of the modern science of syntax (the issue of the borders of the "word combination" notion, the issue of the simple and compound sentence classification, etc.) and the changes happening in the modern syntactical system. Within the frames of this part of the course students learn to identify and choose word combinations from a text, to perform the multi-aspect analysis of word combinations, simple and compound sentences, to analyze the changes happening in the syntactical system of the modern Russian language, to correct the syntactical mistakes occurring in the speech of foreign students, and to explain the reasons for their occurrence.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To provide a theoretical overview of the Russian language grammar: parts of speech, grammatical categories and functioning of a part of speech in the Russian language, the transition from one part of speech to another, a syntagma, a simple and compound sentence, etc. To deal with debatable (unsolved) issues of the modern grammar; to develop students' understanding about the changes happening in the morphological and syntactical system of the modern Russian language. By doing practical tasks to develop students' skills to perform the morphological analysis of a word form and the syntactical analysis of a syntagma or a simple or a compound sentence. To develop students' skills to notice the changes happening in the morphological and syntactical system of the modern Russian language and to analyze these changes.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of the subject a student:
1) knows the morphological and syntactical system and critically evaluates different opinions regarding debatable grammar issues (the typology of the parts of speech, the number of cases, the transition of the parts of speech, the issue of the borderline of the "syntagma" notion, the classification of simple and compound sentences, etc.);
2) can perform the morphological analysis of word forms, in the analysis notices the transition from one part of speech to another;                                                                      
3) performs the multi-aspect analysis of syntagmas, simple and compound sentences;
4) understands the changes happening in the morphological and syntactical system of the modern Russian language, notices these changes in the oral and written Russian language and analyzes them; 
5) prevents and corrects morphological and syntactical mistakes in the speech of foreign students, understands the reasons for occurrence of the mistakes.
