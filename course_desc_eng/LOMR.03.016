The following subjects will be covered during the course: archaea and bacteria as two prokaryotic domains of life; the contemporary classification of prokaryotes; comparison of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell types; specific features of archaea; important milestones and achievements of microbiology. Detailed characterization of the prokaryotic cell: membranes, cell wall, pili and flagella, intracellular inclusions, organelles, storage compounds, endospores. Overview of proliferation of bacteria, relationships of the microbial cells with the environment (including the effects of temperature, pressure, pH, conservants and desinfectants, irradiation and oxygen) and the roles of prokaryotes in nature.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main goal is to obtain basic knowledge on prokaryotes (archaea and bacteria), their diversity and classification, their structuctural and functional features and their relationships with the environmental factors. In addition, the history of microbiology research and the most important achievements will be briefly introduced.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course, the students have obtained basic knowledge on bacteria and archaea, their size, classification and main groups. The students can name the main achievements in microbiology research and the most famous microbiologists. The students are able to name the main elemens in microbial cell and explain their composition, functions and importance, can explain the movement and proliferation strategies of microbial cells and understand how the environmental factors affect the cells. The students are able to connect the main microbial processes to the aspects of everyday life and cycles of nature. The students are experienced in finding suitable study materials (videos) for microbiology, are able to compose a short analysis and conduct primary evaluation on the suitability of the video in studies.
