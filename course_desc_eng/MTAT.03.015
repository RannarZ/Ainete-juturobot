The course presents an introduction into the basic methods of computer 
graphics. The primary focus is on three-dimensional graphics (projection, lighting, 
shadows, texturing, raytracing). On the practice sessions the participants will implement 
the algorithms discussed during the lectures, program using various graphics API 
(primarily OpenGL, but Allegro and perhaps some other libraries will be touched upon), and 
get acquainted with the basics of 3D modeling (using Blender). By the end of the course 
the students should have a solid understanding of the architecture and use of a 
contemporary graphics system, be capable of implementing a simple OpenGL-based application 
as well as a custom 3D-engine. The course requires some previous experience with linear 
algebra and basic programming skills.Objectives/eesmärkid:  After taking the course the student will be   - Knows the basic applications and techniques of computer graphics.   - Has a solid understanding of the structure of the software and hardware of a modern graphics system.   - Is capable of describing and implementing in code the basic two- and three-dimensional rasterisation algorithms.   - Is capable of using the OpenGL API for low-level computer graphics programming.   - Has a solid understanding of the classic "fixed pipeline" logic (OpenGL 1.x). This includes, in particular, the core shading steps (projection, lighting, texturing, etc).   - Is capable of using the programmable pipeline (OpenGL 2.0+).   - Understands the basic 3D modeling formalisms (affine space, homogeneous coordinates, linear transformations, parameterised surfaces, splines, etc).Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After taking the course the student will be   - Knows the basic applications and techniques of computer graphics.   - Has a solid understanding of the structure of the software and hardware of a modern graphics system.   - Is capable of describing and implementing in code the basic two- and three-dimensional rasterisation algorithms.   - Is capable of using the OpenGL API for low-level computer graphics programming.   - Has a solid understanding of the classic "fixed pipeline" logic (OpenGL 1.x).
