The course gives a compact review of essential cellular processes that direct the growth and differentiation of cells in response to various signals from their environment. The specific aim of the course is to emphasise the connections between different topics of molecular and cell biology - from structure of macromolecules to cell differentiation. The course is an introductory step for several follow-up courses in which those processes will be studied in more detail.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this course is to provide an overview of basic molecular processes and their interconnections in directing the cell growth and differentiation.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the course the student: 1. Understands the mechanisms how cells respond to the signals from its environment, what are the mechanisms of signal transduction in cells and how it leads to cell differentiation. 2. Knows the basic principles of protein structure formation and has an overview of the methods that are used for determination of protein structures. 3. Knows the molecular mechanisms leading to cell differentiation. 4. Knows the basic processes that regulate gene expression in different levels.
