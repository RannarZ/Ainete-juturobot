The Baltic Sea region or Northern Europe is not very tightly populated area but there are ten different countries. Each of them has unique political system. There are many similarities between the countries but also several important differences. All except one are liberal democracies. Russian political elite has tried to define their political system as sovereign democracy but in reality it functions as an authoritarian regime where democracy is used only as window dressing. Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have made through a complex transition process during last 30 years and their systems belong to the same group with old democracies in the Nordic countries as well as in Germany. However, during the last years the Polish government has implemented several reforms that have caused hesitation to define Poland as a liberal democracy. Although Germany and Russia are both federal countries then they follow completely different principles. This course focuses on similarities and differences in the Baltic Sea countries, in order to understand how political systems function in these countries. 
The following topics will be addressed: the political systems of the BSR; the defining political system in each particular state; political institutions; constitutions; legislatures; relations between the legislative and executive branch; major political actors behind parties and interest groups in each state and their influence on policy-making, civil and political rights; social trust and tolerance towards minorities, gender equality and social integration.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The objective of this course is to compare and contrast different political systems in the Baltic Sea Region. It reviews party systems and electoral politics, the current state of civil liberties and political rights as well as explores the level of social integration in the countries of the BSR.
