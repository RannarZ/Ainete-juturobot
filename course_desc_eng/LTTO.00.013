The main goal of the course is to give general overview of all basic astronomical branches. The basic subjects are: observational methods; formation of the Solar System; inner structure and atmospheres of planets; structure and evolution of the Sun; solar activity; stellar observations; double stars; star formation and evolution; neutron stars; Milky Way; structure and formation of galaxies; dark matter; active galaxies; basic principles of cosmology; large scale structure of the universe.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of this course is to provide introduction to general astrophysics with special emphasis on the physical processes involved and how these processes can be applied to understand the formation and evolution of planets, stars, interstellar medium, galaxies and other component of the universe.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  On completion of the course the student should be able to:  * discuss the relationship between intensity, flux, effective temperature * knows how to express colors and intensity in magnitudes * explain motion of planets and their satellites with Newtonian dynamics, * explain the structure and formation of Solar system * explain the processes by which energy is generated in stars * explain the formation stages of stars and the end points of stellar evolution * knows basic properties of galaxies and their mass determination methods * explain overall large scale structure of the universe in context of the expansion of the universe
