The course will give a description of observational data and un-derlying physical processes of galaxies and of stellar systems in general. First, fundamental concepts of the physics of stellar sys-tems are presented. This is followed by a short description of star clusters as the simplest stellar systems. Then the fundamentals of stellar dynamics are introduced. The main part of the course is devoted to the description of galaxies, their types and differences between types. The possibilities of the observations are analyzed and corresponding results presented together with possible physi-cal causes of the observables. Main problems of stellar dynamics, characteristic to different types of galaxies are also briefly exam-ined. In the final parts of the course active galactic nuclei are de-scribed and possible mechanisms of galaxy formations are over-viewed.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The objective of the course is to give a overview of the structure and dynamics of star clusters and galaxies.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course, the student: 1. knows the fundamental concepts of the physics of stellar sys-tems and stellar dynamics, 2. is able to distinguish the basic types of stellar systems and un-derstands their main differences, 3. understands principal observational methods for the studies of the structure of stellar systems and their limitations, 4. can explain main observational results on the basis of the physical processes, most likely occurring in stellar systems,  5. has a notion of the present ideas on the galaxy formation and evolution.
