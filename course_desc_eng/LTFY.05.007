The subject of the course is the physical processes in aerosol. Main characteristics and microstructure of aerosol, steady and chaotic motion of the particles, electrical and optical effects in aerosols, generation and transformation of aerosols, and experimental methods of the aerosol investigation are considered. In particular, atmospheric aerosols and their role by formation of the weather and climate is treated.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Climate and weather as well as the contaminating ingredients of the air have the essential influence on the environment of living beings. Particles of atmospheric aerosol play essential role by formation of the weather and climate; they are one of the main components of the dangerous for health air pollution. Artificial aerosols are applied in technology and in medicine. Aim of the present course is to study the physical processes which are the basis of abovementioned effects and applications.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Passing through the course, student knows basic concepts of the aerosol physics; he/she can apply the methods and equations of aerosol mechanics, electrodynamics and optics for solving special problems. The student has a comprehension about the generation and decay processes in open atmosphere, in closed rooms and in laboratory as well as about the transition of the particle size spectrum; he/she understands how the aerosol affects the weather and climate. The student knows the basic methods of the experimental investigation of aerosols.
