Examination of drinking water, surface water and wastewater is carried out. Different chemical and ecotoxicological methods are used.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Carrying out practical work in the field of environmental analysis for the analysis of environmental objects. Deepening the skills of laboratory work and gaining experience working in an environmental analysis laboratory.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student is able to correctly use the basic analytical chemistry labware, can perform weighing and preparing solutions correctly,  is able to independently carry out basic water analysis (COD, BOD, total phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, pH et) used in practice. Can analyze the obtained results and present them correctly. Student knows theoretical basis of the performed analyzes. Student knows applications of the methods. The course also contributes to improvement of the following general learning skills: time management (adhering to deadlines for the required independent works) ability to make oral and written presentations.
