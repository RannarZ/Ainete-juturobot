The chemical composition of the human body and processes that form the basis of life function of the organism. The biochemical mechanisms of  muscle cells` energy supply - during physical activity and rest. An overview of the biochemical changes that form the basis of the formation of the training status.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to give students an idea of metabolic changes occurring in the human organism as a result of exercise and the characteristics of these changes, depending on the nature of exercise.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student 1) is acquainted with the basic terminology of biochemistry, the composition and function of primary biomolecules in the human organism;
2) knows the main biochemical processes occurring in the human body during physical activity and at rest;
3) is able to characterise the chemical composition of muscle tissue and muscle contraction mechanism as well as specify the biochemical peculiarity of different types of muscle fibers;
4) describes the energetic resources of a human organism and their use in different types of physical activity;
5) is able to analyse the biochemical nature of the formation mechanisms of fatigue and recovery processes.
