The lecture course provides information on history of studies of marine environment, geomorphology of the World Ocean, as well on composition, properties and behaviour of seawater. Special situation of the Baltic Sea (low salinity, limited water exchange, high level of pollution, giant recent constructions of dambs, tunnels and bridges) will be examined. Composition of a web-based oceanographic slide is presentation obligatory.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To obtain an introductory overview of the World Ocean and physical processes inside it.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  1. Student has a general overview on the World Ocean, history of discovery, on its composition, vertical structure, thermal and dynamic processes inside it.   2. Student can associate very special physical properties of water as a liquid with microphysical structure of a water molecule. 3. Student understands the impact of salinity on micro- and macrophysical properties of water. 4. Student understands the form of the equation of motion of seawater and single terms of it. 5. Student is competent why the Baltic Sea, as a semiclosed sea, is so special and what is its state now. 6. Student is prepared to study more specialized marine courses like marine dynamics, marine chemistry, marine law etc.
