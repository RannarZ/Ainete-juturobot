Throughout history, people have categorized other humans as "us" and "them", and offered various solutions to the problem as to how different communities should behave towards each other. The history of IR theory has traditionally focused on the interrelations of sovereign states but the idea that the world should consist of such states is itself a historically contingent possibility to create global order. The course will take a look at various solutions to the question of global order provided by Western thinkers from the antiquity to the modern era. We will analyse them on 3 levels: 1) the principles of organizing the world into communities; 2) the mechanisms and principles that determine the functioning and preservation of the global order; 3) normative sphere, or the role and specific content of moral and legal norms in that order. We will address the themes such as civilisation and barbarism, just war, empire and sovereign state, universal monarchy and balance of power, the philosophical foundations of private property and the justification of colonialism. 
The course consists of lectures, seminars and independent study. The lectures provide an introduction to major currents and key thinkers in international thought. The seminars provide an arena for in-depth discussion of particular issues. All students are expected to make at least one oral presentation in seminars (depending on the number of students), to contribute regularly to discussions, and to present an essay at the end of the course.
It is possible to take the course at 3 EAP level (in that case no essay is required).Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the lecture course is:
