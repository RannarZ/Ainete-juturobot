Part 1 covers the following topics:
- Cultural heritage as analysis objects
- IR reflectography, X-radiography, UV analysis
- Optical microscopy 
- IR spectroscopy
- Elemental methods (SEM-EDS, XRF)
-  X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD)
- Chromatography and Mass spectrometry (LC-MS, GC-MS, MALDI-, ESI, APCI-FT-ICR-MS)
- Examples and discussion

Part 2 (Practical work):
- Students will learn how to analyse their samples using optical microscope and ATR-FT-IR spectrometer
- Students will learn to interpret their results
- Students will learn to make conclusions based on the results obtainedObjectives/eesmärkid:  This course gives an overview of different analytical methods used for the analysis of cultural heritage materials. The course consist of two parts: - 1. Theoretical part (mandatory and a prerequisite for a practical part) - 2 EAP - 2. Practical part (a practical part can not be done unless Part 1 has been completed) - 1 EAPLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who has passed the course knows: ... what kind of analytical techniques is available for the analysis of cultural heritage objects ... general theoretical background of different instrumental techniques ... which objects and materials they can be applied to ... what information can be obtained with different instrumental techniques ... main limitations of these analytical methods
