Theoretical mechanics - statics: main definitions and theorems. Newton's laws, force in engineering, couple of forces, torque, the principle of independence of forces, two-dimensional force system, equilibrium equations, the equilibrium of a body in the circumstances of a friction. Basic terminology of the theory of elasticity of the strength of materials: stress; internal force, external force, Hooke's law, deformation, surface moments, stability of a rod subjected to compression. Statics-determined beams, support reactions, diagrams of internal forces (bending moment, shear force, axial force).Objectives/eesmärkid:  Provide students with general knowledge of linear structural elements, the internal forces in linear structural elements caused by external forces, methods for determination, and determination of the load-bearing capacity of such structures.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon successful completion of the course students: -	can prepare a framework (calculation scheme) for a real structure; -	can determine the level of statical indeterminacy of the structure; -	can determine the support reactions and internal forces caused by external forces that influence the framework; -	can determine the characteristics of the cross-sections of the bars of the framework; -	can determine the strength and stability of the framework.
