The aims of the matter are to explain the biochemical, patophysiological and technical background of common laboratory investigations (clinical chemistry and laboratory haematology), to teach students the proper use of the tests and to interpret the test results. Unique feature of the undergraduate curriculum: development to a subject taught throughout four years (III - IV) of clinical studies. The speciality of laboratory medicine is an interdisciplinary laboratory profession which communicates basic and clinical sciences in the fields of clinical chemistry and laboratory haematology. The cycle is part of the basic course in internal medicine.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim is to explain the background of common laboratory investigations, the use of the tests and Interpretation of the test results.
Continue teaching how to used and interprete   the results of most frequent laboratory tests (enzyme, hemostasis, plasma proteins,   concentrations of therapeutic drugs). Special attention will be paid to common forms  of anemia. These results support the  teaching the basic course of internal medicine.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students successfully completed the cycle: 1. know how to interpret the major abnormalities in the results of  enzyme, hemostasis, plasma proteins, and in concentrations of therapeutic  drugs.  2.  can determine,  using laboratory methods of the primary  healt care, the serum values Hb  and the D-dimers. 3. In the event of anemia, the student knows the morphological classification of anemias and is able to use laboratory tests to distinguish between the causes. They know  different characteristics in anemic red blood cell morphology. 4. know modern concept of  blood coagulation and the main investigation techniques: the prothrombin and activated partial thrombin-time,  D-dimers in diagnostcs  and in monitoring. 5. Recognises typical changes of plasma protein fractions, will be able to distinguish between mono- and polyclonal gammopathy. 6. Is aware of the indications to request concentrations of drugs and knows TDM list of drugs, recommended by the WHO,  as well as features of TDM in children, the elderly and request the anticonvulsant asseys.
