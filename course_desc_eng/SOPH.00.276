Covered topics: approaches to intelligence at different levels of descriptions; leading researchers in the field of intelligence; models and theories describing the structure of intelligence; assessment of intelligence; the relationships of intelligence test scores to different life outcomes; genetic and environmental influences to differences in intelligence test scores; reductionist attempts to explain individual differences in psychometric intelligence through different parameters of information processing and brain; group differences; intelligence in everyday life.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The general objective of the course is to give audience a structured outline of the basic approaches to human intelligence differences and of the basic research questions and results related to it. At the end of the course students have to be familiar with the fundamental concepts, know the basic approaches in intelligence research and empirical findings regarding intelligence. In the light of currently dominating theoretical standpoints the students must also be able to distinguish scientifically reasoned point of views regarding human intelligence differences from unscientific ones. The structure of the course attempts to be dialectic, contrasting and synthesising different approaches. The main focus of the course is on contemporary research trends and results.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  At the end of the course students: - have structured outline of basic contemporary approaches to intelligence - know the models describing the structure of intelligence, methods and instruments used for assessing intelligence, and the basics about interpreting assessment results - have overview of the predictive value of psychometrically measured intelligence in terms of different life outcomes - know possible factors that create individual differences in cognitive abilities - know the most common theories that try to explain the cognitive and biological basis of individual differences - have a conception of topics that have drawn public attention to intelligence research, such as possible group differences and the social meaning of individual and group differences.
