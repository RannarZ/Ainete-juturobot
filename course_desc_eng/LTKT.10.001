The course gives a basic understanding of the structures and chemical properties of biomolecules (amino acids, proteins, lipids, mono- and polysaccharides, nucleic acids). We give an introduction to enzymology and the most important metabolic pathways. The main attention is paid to the application of previously learned material (chemistry, biochemistry) in solving various problems and tasks.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Basic course about chemisrty of bioactive molecules and their metabolism. Using knowledge of organic chemistry,  students achieve understanding of chemical essence of several processes of nature. Previously learned knowledge of chemistry and biochemistry will be applied in solving different problems and tasks.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  -	Application of chemical principles in the understanding of biological processes
-	Problem-solving and analysis - finds opportunities to influence and plan biological/chemical processes
-	Knows the basic structures of biomolecules and is able to evaluate their chemical properties.
-	Knows classical methods of analysis of biopolymers.
-	Is able to apply the knowledge of chemistry in the description of reactions of metabolic pathways of biomolecules.
