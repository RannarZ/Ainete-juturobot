The course introduces mathematical methods used in models of economics and knowing of which is needed for understanding of economics textbooks and scientific articles. Mathematical methods considered are illustrated with the examples form economics. The aim of the course is not a perfect analysis and interpretation of models used as an example, the latter will be the topic of further courses.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course gives an experience, how to use different mathematical methods in models of economics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student, who has passed the course * knows different mathematical methods (differentiating, integrating, optimizing, matrix algebra, difference equations) and possibilities to use these methods for analysing economical models; * is able to present problems of economics as a verbal model and to set up a mathematical model on the basis of verbal model; * is able to present mathematical model in graphic form; * is able to choose an appropriate mathematical method for analysing the model and to use this method; * is able to interpret the results of the analysis.
