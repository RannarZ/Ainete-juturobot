During the lectures, seminars and practicums, an overview of key principles of human geographical research is given with the aim of teaching students how to plan and conduct their independent research projects. Both quantitative and qualitative research strategies are addressed and emphasis is put on understanding in which situations both strategies are used and how to combine them. The following methods of data collection and analysis are observed more closely: working with large individual-level data sets, public sources for secondary socio-spatial data, surveys, qualitative interviews, observational approaches and different forms of textual analyses. During the course students analyse existing study reports and scientific articles and compose methodology for survey, interviews, textual analyses and observation and materials needed for carry out these methods. Small groups (3-4 persons) will carry out a research project in which the methods learned are used.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give an overview of the research methods used in human geography and to learn to carry out empirical research.
