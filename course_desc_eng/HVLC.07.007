Course about the importance of translation for the transfer of national and cultural imagesObjectives/eesmärkid:  This course aims at showing how powerful translation is as a procedure of (intentional or unintentional) change. This will be illustrated with examples of national and cultural images that are re-constructed and re-contextualized in translation.
Topics that will be presented and discussed during the classes:
- the different types of images (auto-images, hetero-images, meta-images, but also translated images)
- connections between the disciplines of translation studies and imagology (the study of such images)
- the automaticity of stereotyping on national or cultural grounds
- the position of 'nation' in research
- national stereotyping in (translations of) travel writing
We will sometimes discuss in smaller groups, both on texts about these topics and on examples of national and cultural stereotyping in our everyday readings.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the course student
