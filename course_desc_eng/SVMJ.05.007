The course gives an overview of the theoretical approach to the economic environment, based on the specificities of the Baltic Sea region countries.
The nature of the economic environment is explained by various components, such as the purpose of the enterprise, the economic resources of society (eg natural resources, labor, etc.), fields of activity (eg industry, IT), competitiveness, regulatory environment, foreign trade and investments, infrastructure, anesthetics and others.

The course explains the structural changes in the economies of different countries in the region and explains the different aspects of economic integration (foreign trade, investment, energy, infrastructure, etc.).
Economic policies of different countries (monetary policy, fiscal policy, energy policy, employment policy, social policy, etc.) are also analyzed.
The course also deals with regional cooperation within the framework of the EU Baltic Sea Strategy.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Companies do not operate in a vacuum, but in a framework of certain economic conditions. Such economic conditions (micro- and macroeconomic, social and technological, etc.) form a comprehensive business framework, which we call the economic environment in general. The course has two interrelated goals. 1) give a theoretical overview of the nature of the economic environment and its components in the Baltic Sea region The course provides the basis for understanding the business environment as a whole and highlights its links with different economic disciplines. 2) to explain the specifics of the economic environment on the example of the Baltic Sea region. The countries of the region (10 countries) are treated as a single economic space. This is due to the practical need to provide students with primary systemic information on the economic environment of different countries in the region. Most of the students who have completed the program are employed in the countries of the region. Many foreign students do not have any systematic information about the specifics of the area and the economic environment. The course also has a direct practical purpose in preparing students to work in the countries of the region.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student who passed the subject:
