We are rhetorical beings, living in a rhetorical world. Rhetoric is more than the art of persuasion, or a magical dust of words that can be sprinkled on a text to mislead someone. Rhetoric is inherent in the foundation of human society. This course will look at rhetoric from a contemporary perspective and in a synthesis of different approaches. In particular, we will do this by analysing, writing and delivering speeches. At the same time, everything we learn is transferable to all media and contexts, and all the topics covered are practically applicable in even if the student who has completed the course never writes and/or delivers another speech in their life.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to build a foundation of clear, bold and stylish self-expression on which to build in one's studies. As well as understanding the nature of communication and rhetoric, the aim is to understand oneself in order to see more clearly one's strengths on which one can rely on in the futuure.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student who has completed the course: - Understands the nature of rhetoric and communication and the rhetorical nature of themselves and the world; - Is able to analyse themselves, the audience and the context, to bridge the empathic gap; - Understands the structures of a text, including rhetorical devices, and is able to identify them when analysing a speech; - Can consciously use the structures of a text to create an emotional and intellectual journey in their speeches; - Can produce and deliver a high quality visualised presentation; - Can overcome anxiety and discomfort when speaking in front of a camera and an audience.
