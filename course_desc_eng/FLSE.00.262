Among the main topics discussed are the following: the position of sociosemiotics in semiotics and its connections with other social sciences; the semiotic sources of "sociosemiotics"; "semiotically real world" and "socially constructed reality"; creation of meaningful structures in society; „communication" of cultural phenomena with the social context.; communication as the binding issue for sociocultural systems; possibilities of studying meaningful structures of society.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Participants of the course obtain knowledge of the development of semiotics as connected with other humanities and social sciences at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Comprehension of reasons that took to the divergence of semiotics and semiology will enable to see the relevant selections of research objects. Attention will be paid to the general trend of semiotics that diverged from other social sciences after the renouncement of Unified Science; this knowledge will help to see those methodological differences that appeared in comparison with other social sciences. On the other hand the course aims at designing understanding about the position of semiotics in the set of principle methodological possibilities in contemporary social sciences and humanities. We approach possibilities and problems of the paradigm and methodology of semiotics by the help of different options for the analysis of the creation and maintenance of the semiotic reality.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After accomplishing the course the student:
1)	has knowledge of the semiotic and the semiological paradigm that took to the appearance of sociosemiotics
2)	will be able to evaluate critically studies labelled as sociosemiotic, and to differentiate them from sociosemiotics as a scholarly paradigm. 
3)	understand semiotics as a social science discipline and have knowledge of the principal truths of conducting semiotic analysis in the line of social sciences.
