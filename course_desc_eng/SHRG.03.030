The course begins by looking at the main patterns of political transformation in the region in the late 1980s - early 1990s, during and immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the second part, the typology of the evolution of political regimes in the following decades is introduced, and their current state is discussed. In doing that, the course relies upon the literature on democratization, as well as on the more recent works on the varieties of authoritarianism. The third part of the course consists of country cases that illustrate typical post-Soviet political trajectories and outcomes, ranging between oligarchical pluralism and authoritarian dictatorships. Topics considered for each country vary depending on the their relative importance for the specific case, but in most cases, the list includes constitution and the form of government, relations between the branches of power, political parties and interest groups, corruption, the state of fundamental rights and freedoms. Critical engagement with the concept of transition is a key element of all course sessions.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course presents a comparative overview of political systems in the post-Soviet space, focusing on the critical re-assessment of the transition paradigm.
