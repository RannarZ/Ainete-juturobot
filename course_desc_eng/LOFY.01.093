The seminars provide a overview of the principles and methods of measurements, the treatment of results and evaluation of measurement uncertainty of direct and indirect measurements and applying in school physics.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to introduce principles of measurement theory in school physics. During the cource acquire knowledges and skills how to apply a topic in school physics when doing practical tasks and solving tasks.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course, the student are expected: 1) knows basic facts of metrology; 2) knows common measuring methods and best practices for measuring uncertainty estimations; 3) knows how to plan and apply measuring model; 4) knows how to use the above-mentioned knowledge in the context of school physics.
