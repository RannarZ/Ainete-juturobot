Some more general topics in the field of applied electrochemistry will be studied. Various cyclic voltammetry methods, rotating disc and rotating ring disc techniques, chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, ellipsometry methods will be characterised. More general methods for electroanalysis will be discussed. The applicability limits of various experimental methods for electroanalysis and electrochemical studies will be discussed. Also the quantum chemical models for the electrical double layer structure, adsorption of organic molecules and ions as well as for electrochemical kinetics will be analyzed. The basic principles of various electrochemical energy storage devices (supercapacitors, batteries) will be given.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give an overview of more common methods for use in applied electrochemistry. To apply some of the most important methods and their applications to solve practical problems. To analyze the construction, working principles and applicability of different energy storage devices (supercapacitors, batteries).Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Graduates are able to understand connections between different processes and to apply theoretical knowledge in process planning and use as well as form proper attitudes to encourage creative activities in their speciality, sense of responsibility and life-long learning. Graduates critically evaluates the problems of modern applied electrochemistry and their solutions in the context of sustainable society development.
