The present course of lectures is an introduction to analytic geometry. The following topics are considered in this course of lectures: 1) algebra of vectors (frame and coordinate system, inner product, cross product and triple product of vectors); 2) the equations of straight lines and planes, their applications.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of the present course of lectures is to give to the students of the Faculty of Science and Technology a basic knowledge in a field of geometry. The student develops also learning skills related to numbers and calculation throughout the topics and exercise types covered in the course.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing this course every student: 1. is able to use vectors and operations of a vector algebra for solving simple problems; 2. recognizes the equations of straight lines, given sufficient geometrical data a student is able to find the equation of a straight line, he is also able to determine the mutual positions of two lines in the space and to calculate the distance from a line to a point and the angle between two lines; 3. recognizes the equations of planes, given sufficient geometrical data a student is able to find the equation of a plane in Cartesian coordinates; he is also able to determine the mutual positions of a line and a plane and two planes in a space, to calculate the distance from a plane to a point and the angle between a line and a plane and between two planes. 4. chooses suitable mathematical conceptions (formulae) for problems, and applies these conceptions while solving problems.
