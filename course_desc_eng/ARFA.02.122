The physicochemical properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and excipients affect both the production of dosage forms (formulation) and the performance of the finished product (biopharmaceutical quality). The present course focuses on teaching the physicochemical and solid state properties of APIs and excipients. Pharmaceutical powders and colloidal dispersions (including nano-formulations/nanopreparations and drug delivery systems, DDS) will be introduced and their most important physicochemical properties overviewed. The course introduces also various analytical techniques available for the characterisation of pharmaceutical materials (raw materials, APIs, excipients, powders, dispersions). Novel process-analytical technology (PAT) tools will be discussed for real time process monitoring and control during pharmaceutical manufacturing. The programme follows Martin`s system and classification of physical analysis methods described in EP and USP. The course consists of two parts, in the first part the solid state properties of APIs will be discussed, in the second part the dispersions (including nano-formulations/nanopreparation and DDSs) and their physicochemical properties will be overviewed. Analytical tools will be introduced together with each physicochemical property.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of Physical Pharmacy course is to describe the physicochemical principles behind the design and development of dosage forms and introduce the analytical tools available for active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and excipient characterisation. The information gathered during the course enables understanding the concepts behind pharmaceutical technology, biopharmaceutics and excipients courses. In addition, this knowledge package enables to analyse important physicochemical properties and their characterisation and explain the events in pharmacy by using basic physicochemical principles.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who graduated the course:
- has a basic understanding of the physicochemical principles behind the design of dosage forms and that are important in drug delivery;
- knows how to explain and give examples on the importance of physicochemical parameters in pharmacy (pharmaceutical technology, biopharmacy);
- has an overview of the main analytical tools available for active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and excipients characterisation; 
- has an overview of basic concepts behind each analytical method and an ability to integrate the knowledge;
- is able to connect each physicochemical parameter with the specific analytical tool;
- knows how to explain the basic principles and concepts of analytical methods used for physicochemical characterisation.
- knows how to actively participate in group work, analyse the results and write reports
