Genetics and Philosophy: An Introduction (Cambridge Introductions to Philosophy and Biology). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511744082. The student will read the book and discuss it in a seminar before all PhD students (and interested audience from the institute and beyond). There will be 23 such seminars per semester.
