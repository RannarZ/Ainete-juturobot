State the normal flora and infective microorganisms of the human oral cavity  and describe the host parasite relationship 2. List the pathogenic microorganisms, their general characteristics, classifications, nomenclature and methods of identification of bacteria 3. State the sources, modes of transmission and describe the pathogenesis of the diseases produced by the microorganisms. 4.  Apply the methods of sterilization and disinfection to prevent and control infections 5.  Recommend the laboratory investigations for making a microbiological diagnosis. 6. Use the correct method of collection, storage and transport of clinical specimens for microbiological investigations 7. Plan and interpret laboratory investigations for the diagnosis of infectious diseases and to correlate the clinical manifestations with the etiologic agents. 8. Identify the common infectious agents with the use of basic laboratory procedures and the use of sensitivity tests to select suitable antimicrobial agents.
