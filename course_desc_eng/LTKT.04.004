The course provides a comprehensive overview about the main technologies used in municipal wastewater treatment and sludge management technologies. The technologies of physicochemical and biological wastewater treatment are systematically related to the laboratory wastewater analyses and are also brought into the concept of legal framework. The course addresses all major technological aspects of nutrient removal and cost-effective sludge management. Process dimensioning is addressed according to valid standards for major wastewater treatment technologies.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course it to introduce wastewater and sludge treatment technologies and learn the principles for dimensioning of treatment facilities.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student: 1. knows the methods of wastewater treatment used in municipal wastewater treatment plants; 2. is able to choose the wastewater treatment technology on the basis of wastewater analyses and effluent limits; 3. knows the dimensioning principles of wastewater and sludge treatment technology and can dimension the process; 4. is able to optimize the wastewater treatment process.
