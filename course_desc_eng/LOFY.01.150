State curriculum in science needs development of higher order cognitive skills using active methods of teaching and learning in the science course. Methods of problem based learning, project learning, guided inquiry learning and other active methods will be provided, with the aim of using them in the teaching and learning process in the basic school. Workshops and seminars during the course will prepare students to introduce new methods into teaching process at school.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Students get an overview about strategies in active learning and teaching methodology in science and skills in introducing them into the study process.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course, the students are expected: 1. Ability to conduct student-centered learning process according to productive teaching approach 2. Know and use rules of individual and group studying while planning physics class 3. Use appropriate activation methods for best achievement of objectives; approach studying creatively 4. Develop critical thinking, analytical and synthesis skill in students 5. Ability to plan the process of structuring and systematizing physics knowledge according to the student's development. 6. Knowledge of and ability to exploit the rules of exploratory and problem based learning 7. Ability to choose assessment methods in accordance to active teaching methods and the use of formative assessment and encouraging feedback 8. It aims to provide learners with the necessary and reliable information and to use it effectively to solve problems.
