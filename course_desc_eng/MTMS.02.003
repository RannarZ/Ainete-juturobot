Overview of basic stochastic processes is given: Markov chains, random walk, Poisson processes, Markov chains with continuos time, birth and death processes, queueing systems, renewal processes, Brownian motion, stationary processes. The properties of processes and the relations between different types of processes are introduced, several related exercises are solved.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is - to give an overview of main stocastic processes - to introduce the tools for analyzing stochastic processes and solving related problems.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Participants who pass this course  - understand the nature of a stochastic process and know main stochastic processes; - know the main properties of more important stochastic processes; - are able to use obtained knowledge to solve problems related to stochastic processes.
