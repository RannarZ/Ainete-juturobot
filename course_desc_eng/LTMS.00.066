Normal forms of propositional formulas.  Predicates and quantifiers. Proof trees. Main equivalences of predicate logic.   Graphs. Walks, cycles, connected graphs. Trees. Spanning trees. Minimum weight spanning trees.   Directed graphs. The shortest path problem.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give basic knowledge of mathematics needed in computer science and to develop the ability of structured thinking and abstraction.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing this course the student  1. Has acquired a systematic and coherent overview of main discrete structures used in computer science and of corresponding concepts, results and methods. 2. Can construct mathematical arguments in areas covered by the course and express them clearly using the standard terminology and notations. 3. Can express statements using propositional and predicate formulas, establish properties (e.g. satisfiability, validity) of and relations (e.g. equivalence, consequence) between these formulas, convert formulas into equivalent formulas in a suitable form, and relate the results to the original statements; 4. Can apply mathematical induction to prove statements. 5. Can explain, illustrate with examples, and associate with each other the basic notions of graph theory, can use graphs and trees to model situations, and draw conclusions about the situation using basic properties of graphs and trees.
