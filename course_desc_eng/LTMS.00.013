In this course a short overview of  some parts of probability theory , random processes and statistics is given that are necessary for passing other courses in the curricula of Actuarial and Financial Engineering. The concepts of probability, random variable, and expected value are presented from measure-theoretic point of view. As basic random processes, Markov chains, Poisson processes and Brownian motion are introduced. Linear regression is handled by means of matrix algebra.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The purpose of the subject is to prepare students for the courses that assume knowledge of probability and statistics: * to give short overview of  probability (axiomatic aspect), * to introduce basic stochastic processes, * to introduce basics of statistical modelling.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The students who have passed the course * know and are able to apply main concepts and results  of probability theory * know basic stochastic processes, including Markov chains, Poisson processes and Brownian motion, * have knowledge and skills for applying linear regression analysis.
