Set theory: Notion of a set, operations with sets, relations, relations of equivalence and partitions to the classes, cardinality of a set, ordered sets. Injective, surjective and bijective functions. Number theory: divisibility, division algorithm, fundamental theorem of arithmetic, infiniteness of the set of primesObjectives/eesmärkid:  Giving first knowledge to the students about modern mathematics of application general notions and methods.
