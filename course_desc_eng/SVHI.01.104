The course addresses how we can use futures thinking to create innovations. To do that, we start by looking at what innovation means and recognising the limits of how we usually think of innovation (based on backward-looking type thinking).
Next, we analyse the various ways we usually think about the future, focusing on the limits of design and planning regarding more complex systems (such as classrooms, schools, and society at large). Then we shift towards more flexible ways of engaging the future, including questioning the dominant narratives of desirable futures and creating our visions.

The following topics will be addressed:
The limits of backward-looking type of thinking when it comes to innovation and innovative thinking;
The limits of design and planning when it comes to complex sociotechnical contexts;
The nature of futures thinking and its role in creating alternative futures; 
Futures workshop as a methodology to create desirable futures.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course aims at engaging students in thinking about innovation in the context of creating futures. This includes recognising the limits of prediction and design, dealing with sociotechnical complexity, and learning to engage the present to give rise to desirable futures. Specifically, the objectives of the course are: to share experiences and insights on innovation in the context of futures thinking; to give an overview of futures thinking; to develop a reflective stance on approaching futures.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of the course the student is able: to analyse the various methods with which we engage the future; to understand the limits of prediction and planning; to participate in the creation of desirable alternatives for the future.
