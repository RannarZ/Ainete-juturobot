The subject is interactive, which means that each meeting consists of a short theoretical introduction, followed by a discussion in groups, and interesting real life cases; cases are analyzed and/or solved where necessary. Learners may themselves offer cases of their own practice, which will be analyzed together. The existing international and Estonian legal provisions, policy analysis and existing research results must be used in the solving of cases. This allows students to combine their practical experiences, theoretical knowledge and expand their professional competence. Within the framework of the subject, a variety of measures are planned to allow students to test different roles, such as how to be a neglected child, no one listens to, a young offender who is demonized, a practitioner who has insufficient professional knowledge and overburdened with bureaucratic tasks, etc.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course gives an overview of social processes and situations that pose risks for members, groups of a particular community to become marginalized and to be excluded from the community or society. When thinking about these processes, we focus on the theoretical knowledge of the sociology of deviant behavior (explanation theories). Social policy analyses, such as the impact analysis of recent reforms in Estonia, including the reform of the child protection system and substitute care (2016) on the special treatment of juvenile offenders (2018).  At the same time, we plan to focus on the perspective of the subject, i.e. analyze the reactions caused by insufficient integration and exclusion of the person/group, and to evaluate various interventions that support marginalization and withdrawal from the community, and to compare positive interventions such as restorative justice, narrative therapy and solution-centred short therapy that help stop marginalization and strengthen the development of a coherent society.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  As part of this course, the students will study the marginalization process via theories of explanation concerning individuals/groups/communities in social relations with their environments. The focus is on the interaction of individual peculiarities and relationships in human/group/community choices. This is an inevitable knowledge to understand and prevent social risks. On one hand, a good practitioner must know that no person is born as a criminal, but develops into one relating with other people and institutions in their growth environment. Therefore, an analysis of environmental risks is necessary for prevention and intervention in order to avoid focusing on the accusation of an individual. At the end of the course, the student  - knows the basic theories that explain disturbing behavior and marginalization;  - knows the general social risks that may lead to the marginalization of people, groups and communities;  - is able to analyze and evaluate these risks, sees the complete and complex picture;  - knows the modern science-based intervention and prevention methods;  - takes social risks and prevention professionally and responsibly;  - is able to avoid accusations of a single person/group/community, knowing that accusation only increases the risk of marginalization;  - is ethical in their professional activities.
