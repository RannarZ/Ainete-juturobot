While technology is usually conceived and investigated from the standpoint of those who design it, the significance and practical meaning that technology acquires over time is very much rooted in the way in which people and communities continuously tinker with technology creating purposes and new uses that were not originally envisaged by designers. This bears an untapped potential for education that this course would like to investigate.
The course is divided into three parts. The first part will offer a general introduction to an alternative approach to technology based on the notions of tinkering. This part of the course will provide the conceptual backbone for the activities that will be carried out in the next phases. 
In the second part of the course students will be engaged in conducting an ethnographic inquiry whose main aim will be to allow them to apply ethnographic "tools" to gain first-hand knowledge into the practical meaning that tinkering have or may have in more educational practices. This part will be the chance for students to explore practically the notions described in the first part. 
The third part of the course will be devoted to presenting and sharing the insights gained during the ethnographic inquiry.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main goal of the course is to provide an overview and a first-hand experience concerning an alternative approach to technology that is based on the notions of tinkering. Specifically, the objectives of the course are: to get acquainted with the notions of tinkering with technology as alternative approach to technology in education; to explore the broader significance of tinkering with technology in our contemporary society; to identify, articulate and then share the main practical implications of a more bottom-up approach to technology based on tinkering for education; to gain first-hand experience as to the nature and practical relevance of tinkering in one's learning activities and workplace.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing the course, the student: (1)	will be acquainted with the notions of tinkering with technology as an alternative approach to technology in education;  (2)	will be able to make sense of the broader significance of tinkering with technology in our contemporary society; (3)	will be able to identify, articulate and then share the main practical implications of a more bottom-up approach to technology based on tinkering for education;  (4)	has first-hand experience as to the nature and practical relevance of tinkering in one's everyday life and workplace; (5)	has first-hand experience with an alternative approach to technology in education based on tinkering.
