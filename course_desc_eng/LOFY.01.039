Basics of probability theory are introduced. The most general distribution laws of random quantities, occurring in nature and exact sciences, are treated. The basics of statistical analysis of random quantities are introduced. An overview of measurement uncertainties and their handling with means of probabilistic approach is presented.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give minimum knowledge in basics of observation and measurement data handling, including the data reduction and processing in practical work classes of physics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course, the students are expected: 1.	to know the essential rules of metrology;  2.	to be able to use most common distribution laws for measuring procedures;  3.	to be able to estimate the measurement and its expanded uncertainty at requested confidence level from the measured data;  4.	to be able to analyze the measurement result and corresponding uncertainty reliability and to distinguish significant and insignificant components of the uncertainty;  5.	to be able to plan and to optimize the measurement methodology from requested error limits and the measuring instruments available.
