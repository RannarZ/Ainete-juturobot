The course is divided conceptually into two larger parts:
1) the theory, logic and methods to establish causality behind impact assessment/evaluation
2) application of the methods on actual use cases and the interpretation of the results

The course will consist primarily of interactive lectures. The first part of the lecture gives an example of the problem and an actual impact assessment. This is followed by a practical task where students have to use the same analytical approach to go through the steps needed to conduct an impact assessment for a defined problem. 
For selected examples, an actual data driven impact assessment will be conducted in class and the results interpreted.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of impact assessment is to reduce the inherent uncertainty in any decision-making process, as well as to evaluate the outcomes of the decisions and actions taken. The need for impact assessment is universal but especially important in making policy and business decisions and re-evaluating their outcomes. Depending on the field conducting an impact assessment might even be compulsory, such as evaluating the impact of draft laws in the legislative process. Similarly, policy analysis ex post is crucial to ensure that public funds are being used responsibly and effectively.

The objective of this course is to demonstrate practical impact assessment before and after a decision, policy or business choice has been made. The course will introduce various formalized and not formalized impact assessment methods and tools that allows to arrive at measurable impact values. Both ex ante and ex post as well as qualitative and quantitative impact assessment methods will be examined. Also, market analysis and regulation impact assessment will be separately examined. Finally, policy analysis techniques will be examined in brief in order to understand which exact methods would be suitable for impact evaluation in the given policy designs.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon successfully passing the course students: 1) are able to dissect the analytical stages needed to conduct a policy impact assessment 2) know the main theoretical approached to impact assessment and practical methods used to conduct an assessment 3) can conduct an evidence-based impact assessment before and after a policy or business decision has been made; 4) can identify metrics usable for impact evaluation; 5) understand which type of data is necessary to be able to conduct impact assessment; 6) know and can apply qualitative impact assessment methods.
