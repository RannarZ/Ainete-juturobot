This course overviews: a) theory and mechanisms of film formation, b) types of modern aqueous film and nano-coatings, c) different types of coating processes, d) common types of coatings for tablets and multiparticulates, e) coating process control and measuring systems, f) coating defects and limitations, g) coating PAT and PIT issues, h) film and nano-coating materials (polymers, plasticizers, colourants and solvents), i) compression coating principles, j) controlled release coatings, i) free films and final product characterization of coated dosage forms.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The objective of the present course is to provide an advanced level knowledge on pharmaceutical coating technologies (including sugar, film, compressed and modern thin/nano coating technologies). More specifically, the course will cover layering and film formation mechanisms, testing of film properties, materials selection, coating process control and measuring systems, film coating PAT/PIT, scale-up issues, nano coating technologies, controlled release coating applications and final product characterization.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who has passed the course: - knows history and background of pharmaceutical coatings - knows theory of pharmaceutical film formation  - knows basic methods and techniques in solvent-mediated coating (including thin and nanocoatings) - knows basic methods for pharmaceutical compressed coating      - knows the commonly used sugar/film/compressed coating  materials and their properties - has basic knowledege on coating process including key process parameters and process monitoring/control principles - understand the significance of PAT/PIT in pharmaceutical coating
