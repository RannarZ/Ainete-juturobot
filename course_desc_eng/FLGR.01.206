The course is based on a comparative analysis of the theory of Canadian multiculturalism and the experience of living in Canadian multicultural society. In order to understand the literary as well as historical and cultural contexts of Canadian Aboriginal and immigrant writing, the course first provides basic knowledge of the formation of Canadian population and Canada's development from a bicultural to a multicultural nation. In the seminars the works by a number of Native, Inuit, European, Asian and Black Canadian authors are analysed, with an aim to learn to see and understand the problems and issues faced by different individuals and communities as well as Aboriginal and immigrant generations in Canada. The course ends with an insight into the current debates in Canadian society concerning multiculturalism and its limits.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To provide an overview of Canadian literature in English by Native, Inuit, European, Asian and Black Canadian authors as well as its contexts.
