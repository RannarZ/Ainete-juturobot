The course consists of two parts: Part 1 covers siliciclastic sediments and Part 2 covers the carbonate sediments. In theorethical lectures of the course the deposition, diagenesis and geodynamic evolution of the sedimentary rocks and sedimentary basins with characteristic features pointing to different environments and  deiagenetic conditions is discussed. The focus of the course is on laboratory analysis of sediments and sedimentary rocks,  the workload and main basis for student evaluation will consist of laboratory exercises rather than exam.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course is an introduction to sedimentary rocks their constituents, environments of deposition, and the diagenetic processes that alter them. Digfeerent structural-texturtal and chemical mineralogical analyses are studied and used iLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students are expected to learn recognition of sedimentary constituents, naming of sedimentary rock types, and interpretation of depositional and diagenetic processes based on hand sample, thin-section, mineralogical and chemical analysis of sedimentary rocks.
