The module provides practical examples of data and data interpretation. Each day includes a variety of teaching methods, including lectures and interactive seminars. Students analyse published works and pre-compiled data sets. Students are expected to evaluate the literature critically and determine its value within the overall evidence base. They are instructed in the use of basic statistical methods. Learners are also tested informally through short interactive tests; analysis of the group's responses is also important. 
These are transferable skills that would be of benefit to all clinical researchers.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal is to provide the student with a scientific toolbox that facilitates an understanding of clinical science.
