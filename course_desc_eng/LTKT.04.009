The course analyzes important analytical methods in environmental chemistry, analyzes their applicability, advantages and disadvantages, and calculates concentrations and other parameters according to the analytical method. The aim of the course is to understand and deepen the methods of analytical environmental chemistry, as well as to refine chemical calculation skills. The latter is assessed by compulsory homework.
In small groups, complex, possibly vital problem tasks are solved, which require a combination of knowledge of different chemistry topics, creative thinking, self-expression and group work skills.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Solving environmental chemistry problems, working out computational problems in a small group. Deeper understanding of analytical environmental chemistry methods. During the course also complicated problem tasks are solved, which require combining knowledge of different chemistry topics and group work skills. The course can only be completed as an e-course, in which case the student works independently according to the schedule.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student who has completed the course: - describes analytical methods such as titration, spectrophotometry, oxygen demand methods and chromatography; - calculates the concentrations of the substances in the solutions;   -analyzes a more complex problem as a group.
