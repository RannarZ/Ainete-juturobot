The principal objective is to provide an overview about the field methods of so-called "green biology" that are focused on forest ecology and fungi-driven natural biogeochemical processes.
The course is held as a three-day trip in various forests, where lectures are concurrently given about ecosystem functioning including plant mineral nutrition and decomposition as well as identification and use of mushrooms. A brief overview about research methods of ecologists and biosystematicists are given based on examples from plants and fungi.
Course participants must write an 1-page essay that is based on knowledge gained during the field activities.
Credits are provided upon participation in the field course and completion of the essay.Objectives/eesmärkid:  overview of forest ecology and fungi-driven ecosystem processes; identification of important edible and poisonous mushrooms; brief overview of modern ecological and biosystematics methodsLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  1.
