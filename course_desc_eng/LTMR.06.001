An overview of cells as elementary units of life and their main principles of functioning.
An overview of the pro- and eucaryotic cell structure as well as of the structure, composition and processes in main organelles (nucleus, nucleolus, chloroplast, mitochondrion, endoplasmatic reticulum, Golgi complex, lysosome, peroxisome, proteasome). The role of and interactions between various cell organelles. The cytoskeleton: microfilaments and microtubules, its motor proteins. The structure and composition of biomembranes, membrane transport. The cell cycle and its regulation. The methods for the investigation of the cell structure and compositionObjectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to equip students with a basic knowledge about pro- and eukaryotic cell structure, functioning and mechanisms of cell metabolism regulation.
The primal aim of the subject is to give deeper knowledge about animal cell construction and functions.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who passed the course: 1. Knows the basic postulates of cell theory; 2. Is able to characterize the cell structure, chemical composition, gene structure and expression specificity in pro- and eucaryotes; 3. Is able to describe the structure of membranes and how membranes connect different cell compartments to each other and with environment; 4. Is able to describe structure and main reactions in different organelles; 5. Will understand the cellular components underlying mitotic cell division and cell cycle regulation; 6. Will apply their knowledge of cell biology to selected examples of changes or losses in cell function.  7. Is able to characterize basic methods of cell biology (different microscopy and chromatography types, marked antibodies, flow cytometry)
