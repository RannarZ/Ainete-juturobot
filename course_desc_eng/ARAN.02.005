General principles of the microscopic structure of tissues and organs as well stages of early human embryonic development are studied. During practical classes characteristics of tissues and organs are investigated by means of examination of histological slides. The duration of the course is two semesters - in the first semester in general histology basic tissue types are studied and overview of early stages of human embryonic development is given, in the second semester in special histology microscopic structures of organs and organ systems are studied.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course of histology aims to provide students with an understanding of the microscopic structure and development of cells, tissues and organs, with emphasis in the correlation between structure and function. The course provides a practical experience in the examination of histological slides and gives the basis of understanding of normal tissue and organ structure, which is essential in further studies in order to understand the pathological changes in the human body produced by various diseases.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the end of the course, the student should be able to:  1. Understand the essence of the steps in the preparation of histological specimens and efficiently use microscope to study histological slides 2. Describe the stages of the early human embryonic development, embryogenesis of tissues and organs, and understand the causes of malformations. 3. Describe the structural characteristics of the basic tissue types and relate functional capabilities of each tissue type with their structure 4. Understand the basic principles of organ construction 5. Define and describe the histological characteristics of normal organs and relate the structure of organs and organ systems with the function.
