The laboratory course complementary to the course of Physical Concept of the World for the first year students of bachelor's studies in physics-chemistry- materials science to improve their theoretical and to gain practical skills in experimental design and technique and the basic elements of data processing.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of this course is provide students with the opportunity to develop skills in common electrical, optical and methods of molecular physics and procedures that are routinely used in the lab. To make students acquainted with basic experimental techniques and estimation of their uncertainties.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the laboratory course, the students are expected: * to have the experimental and analytical skills required for physical experiments, basic knowledge on relationships between physical quantities and their measuring units; * to know the most common measurement methods, measuring instruments and devices used in the field of mechanics, heat, electricity and optics, can apply them in practice; * to know elementary rules of electrical safety and other safety arrangements; * to be able to compare the experimental results and theory, to discuss about the reality of experimental values; * to be able to report the results of an experiment and demonstrate the knowledge and understanding of error analysis.
