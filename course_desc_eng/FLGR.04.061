The seminar deals with German language literary texts from the beginning to the end of the 19th century, introducing to some of the key authors such as Gryphius, Lessing, Lenz, Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, Hölderlin, Mörike, Tieck, Büchner, Heine, Fontane and Hauptmann. The course will concentrate on close reading techniques and hermeneutics and focus on the discussion and analysis of selected literary works, but touching on various issues of literary methodology and theory.
