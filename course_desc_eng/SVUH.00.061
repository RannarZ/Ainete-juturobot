The internship requires that the student become thoroughly informed about the activities of an institution or organisation that offers professional opportunities for a sociologist or a social science analyst. The student has to devise and carry out a problem-based project with the aim of solving a complete task in said organisation. The project can be done either in a team of students or alone.

The Project Management Internship presupposes that the internship activities make up an integrated whole (the project) and follow a problem-based approach, namely that
- a problem which needs solving is defined along with a goal that is to be reached; 
- main questions are phrased that need answering in order to solve the problem;
- specific tasks and methods to be used are identified along with what additional knowledge and skills need to be acquired; 
- the output of the project is defined (what the result of the project should entail in terms of subject matter and how it should be presented).

The project should include an analytical part, i.e. the project cannot be based on technical tasks alone, but should entail producing an analytical output (e.g., a report based on data analysis that includes not only reporting tables and graphs but also interpreting them) or at least a methodological contribution (e.g., if the goal of the project is cleaning a database and preparing data for analysis, the intern should also get to work out the methods for it (e.g., logical tests) and carry out explorative analysis.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Acquaint oneself with BA level professional work in a particular subfield Develop the skills to apply knowledge gained in studies into practice and analytical and reflection skills Improve employment opportunities in the labour market after graduation Devise and complete a problem-based project in an internship organisation.
