Preparation of presentations and their presentation at scientific seminars and conferences. The principles of job accounting are as follows:
* Up to 12 ECTS credits for a doctoral student from one of the regular seminars.
It is possible to get a maximum of 3 ECTS in one semester, proportionally fewer points are awarded for seminars held on a smaller scale. A minimum of 60% attendance plus a presentation is required in the semester, only the presentation gives 1 ECTS.
* A doctoral student receives a minimum of 6 ECTS from presentations / conferences outside the institute. By the way:
1. Self-presented oral presentation at an international conference (may also take place in Estonia), certified in ETIS with a piece of writing in categories 3.1, 3.4, 5.1 or 5.2 - 3 ECTS.
2. Poster presentation at an international conference, if the doctoral student has stood next to the poster, certified in ETIS with a letter of category 3.1, 3.4, 5.1 or 5.2 - 1 ECTS.
3. Self-presented oral presentation at a doctoral school event (conference, seminars, etc.) - 1 ECTS.
4. Poster presentation at a doctoral school event (conference, seminars, etc.), if the doctoral student has stood next to the poster - 1 ECTS
5. Reports outside of a research institution that do not belong to clause 1 or 2 - 1 ECTS.

There is no need to register for Doctoral Seminar in the Study System, the credits points are entered to the Study System by the person responsible for the Doctoral Seminar course.
However, the doctoral student must inform the person responsible for the Doctoral Seminar course by e-mail about all student's credit-worthy activities, including submitting references to the conference programs where the doctoral student is listed as a speaker or poster presenter.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The PhD student gains experience in scientific communication.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The PhD student who passed the course successfully: -  Is able to analyze critically his/her own scientific results and the results of other scientists, -  Is able to use scientific terminology on the professional level, - Is able to present and explain his/her scientific results to the researchers of the same specialty, -  Is able to present and explain his/her scientific results to the broad scientific community.
