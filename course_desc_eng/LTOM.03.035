This course introduces 3D geomodelling techniques in Leapfrog specialised software, discussed in a synthesis on theory, and implemented in practical exercises and real-life industry case studies.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The purpose of the course is to provide basic theoretical knowledge of scientific and industrial geological 3D modeling and to consolidate knowledge by completing practical exercises using the Leapfrog softwareLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After successful completion of the course, the student:   (1) is familiaar with the fundamentals of geomodelling, topology, discrete models, grids, geostatistics and interpolation;  (2) knows the 3D data sources: surface geology, borehole, and geophysal data (e.g. 2D and 3D seismics);  (3) can operate in Leapfrog software: knows the problems and functionalities;  (4) is able to model a simple layer-cake stratigraphy;  (5) can include fault networks to the model;  (6) can model cylindrical folds;  (7) can model complex geo-bodies;  (8) is able to compose representation, modelling and simulation of properties of geological objects;  (9) can do simple modelling from a 3D seismics dataset
