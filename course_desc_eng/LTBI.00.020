"Development of new drug to treat infectious diseases and other conditions is currently facing both unprecedented opportunities and challenges; the later having more significant effect. Few drug reaching market, increasing prices of novel drug has generated negative image of pharmaceutical industry that has far reaching consequence. It is crucial that students in Bioengineering curriculum have objective understanding of the technologies and challenges in drug development. 

Part of course dedicated to principles of drug development will provide overview of drug development process and its different stages. Main goals and challenges associated with each of stage will be highlighted. Special cases (such as orphan drug development) will be analyzed, Students are expected to analyze "real life" situation in drug development by analyzing of pipelines of pharmaceutical companies. Practical training includes hands-on "Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the  course is to  show, using practical examples, principles of modern drug design and development. This is essential for general understanding of complexity of the process, critical stages of development process and main hurdles that limit efficiency of novel drug developmentLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students have theoretical understanding and practical experience about different approaches of drug design and early (discovery and preclinical) stages of drug development
