This is an introductory course of algebra. The following topics are considered: 1) matrices, operations with matrices; 2) determinant of a matrix, Laplace theorem, reciprocal matrix; 3) vector space over the field of real numbers, subspace, basis, coordinates of a vector; 4) linear system of equations and their solutions Gauss-Jordan elimination, Cramer's rule; 5) complex numbers, operations with them.Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course gives basic knowledge in linear algebra. The student develops learning skills related to numbers and calculation throughout the topics and exercise types covered in the course.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing this course every student: 1. knows the properties of matrices and determinants and is able to formulate and prove them; 2. is able to calculate the inverse matrix; 3. knows what is a vector space and is able to give examples of vector spaces, to formulate and prove main properties of vector space; 4. knows the Gauss' method and Cramer's rule for solving systems of linear equations and is able to use these for solving noncomplicated problems; 5. knows complex numbers, their algebraic, geometric and trigonometric form, is able to carry out arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, division) with them; 6. chooses suitable mathematical conceptions (formulae) for problems, and applies these conceptions while solving problems.
