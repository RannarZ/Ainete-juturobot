Hydrodynamics (the fluid mechanics) is a special branch of theoretical mechanics. Fluids and gases are considered as continuous environments, neglecting their molecular structure. However, for explanation of some properties of fluids and gases, e.g. the viscosity, their discrete internal structure is considered. The lecture course is focusing on simple everyday hydrodynamics problems: compressibility of liquids and gases, hydraulic shock, wind damages of roofs, water supply in buildings, planning of bursting and watering, siphoning, measurements of blood pressure, ventilation of internal rooms.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To acquire basic knowledge on hydrodynamics for understanding motion of fluids and gases in the nature (the ocean and the atmosphere), in technologocal systems (pipes, tubes) and in the human bodies (the blood system).Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Intended learning outcomes (ILOs). Upon completion of this course, the participants are trained to: 1.	Understand the basic quantities and laws of hydrodynamics. 2.	Perceive causes of wind damages on buildings and to outline avoiding of such damages. 3.	Explain free fall of bodies in the gases and liquids. 4.	 Know how to solve problems of bursting,watering and free falling. 5.	To outline update of water supply and ventilation systems in buildings. 6.	To measure correctly blood pressure. 7.	Are able to perform calculations of centrifugation.
