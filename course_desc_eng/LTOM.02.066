During the course, the factors related to the ecological and social sustainability of urban areas are addressed in the context of global changes. The course addresses the development and planning of urban areas, and relationships between urban socio-ecological conditions, human health, and well-being. The course develops framework that integrates climatic, ecological, societal, individual, and man-made environment-related factors critical to urban sustainability. Possible spatial planning solutions and intervention measures that enable to build socially and ecologically sustainable cities are discussed throughout the course. The course introduces models of sustainable cities, discusses nature-based and technological solutions that ensure sustainability, and develops concepts of future 'circular' cities. The course includes group works that analyse exemplary problems in local governments and plan relevant interventions.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course aims to advance the understanding of urban sustainability concept in the context of global change, under pressing social and environmental challenges. The course combines knowledge from different disciplines to build a strong interdisciplinary approach that enables to understand, consider, and govern challenges of urban areas in the 21st century. The course tackles concepts and practices of sustainable urban development, targeting climatic, ecological, environmental, social, cultural, health-related, and behavioural factors, investigating the impact of urban systems and living environments to individuals and vice versa. The course focuses on novel principles and applications of sustainable urban design and spatial planning that link social and ecological systems in cities and combine socioeconomic aspects with climate change mitigation and adaptation, circular resource use, biodiversity conservation and restoration and application of nature-based solutions.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After fulfilling the course, the student: *	understands the concept, strategic framework, components, and underlying principles of sustainable development in urban areas; *	knows the factors related to the ecological (incl. biodiversity, ecosystem services, climate, pollution, sounds) and social (incl. population distribution and activity locations, mobility infrastructure, the availability and accessibility of services) systems of cities, their formation, temporal-spatial variability and the impact on people's health and well-being; *	knows the principles of spatial planning and urban design, and knows how to plan interventions depending on the content of the problem, spatial resolution, and stakeholder needs; *	knows how to combine social, technological, and nature-based solutions in spatial planning and apply them in solving different challenges in urban setting; *	is able to critically assess the impacts and effectiveness of different interventions in urban areas, and consider the context of uncertain climate and population changes when planning interventions and evaluating their performance.
