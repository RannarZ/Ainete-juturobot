A survey on main structures of contemporary algebra: vector space, group, semigroup, ring, field, module, lattice, universal algebra, category. In every case many exampls presented and main resultsof the corresponding theory are discussed.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give a preliminary survey of most important from the point of view of applications algebraic structures. These are vector spaces over arbitvary fields, groups, abelian groups, rings, modules, semigroups, acts, lattices, universal algebras and categories.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing this course every student: 1. is able to construct factor structures of main algebraic structures; 2. knows homomorphism and isomorphism theorems and is able to use their corollaries; 3. knows and is able to use main algebraic constructions (direct product, direct sum, band of semigroups and others); 4. is able to use the general induction and Zorn's lemma in proofs; 5. knows main concepts of category theory (monomorphism, epimorphism, product, coproduct).
