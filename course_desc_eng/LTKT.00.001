The students become acquainted with the principles behind scientific method, mechanisms ensuring research integrity, importance of correct data analysis and presentation; learn to distinguish characteristics of science and pseudoscience; and master use of the scientific databases. The obtained knowledge is applied for the thorough analysis of the publications and theses defended during the preceding years. Next, the students will perform a short research project in a chosen laboratory within the UT Institute of Chemistry to gain experience in the following aspects: formulation of hypotheses and planning of the according experimental solutions; carrying out pilot experiments; analysis of the results and presentation of those to the public specialized in the given field.
The course also contributes to improvement of the following general learning skills:
a) time management (adhering to deadlines for the required assignments),
b) participation in the team project (homework assignments performed as team work; communication with the mentor, setting up the personal activities within the functioning research group),
c) giving feedback (anonymous review of the presentations made by other students),
d) presenting in front of a large audience.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the first part of this course is to give the students an overview of the scientific method characteristics, scientific career options in academia and in industry, quality assessment criteria of the scientific publications, and the Estonian Code of Conduct for Research Integrity. As a general goal, the critical thinking and reading skills of students will be developed. Using their newly acquired skills, the students will perform deep analysis of an BSc or MSc thesis (defended during the preceding years at the UT Institute of chemistry) or an experimental research article (cited in WOS/Scopus), and present it in the form of a short talk followed by the academic discussion. The aim of the second part of this course is to review various relevant scientific databases, and teach students basic academic writing skills as well as planning of the experimental work. The students will carry out a short practical research project supervised by a member of the UT Institute of chemistry, and summarize it as a written report and as an oral presentation. The course will prepare students to progress successfully through the process of preparation of their BSc theses.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  1st part of the course: 1.	A student is familiar with the characteristics of high-quality science, scientific misconduct, and pseudoscience (assessed by homework); 2.	A student is able to formulate examples of and a personal concept regarding the importance of fundamental vs applied science, and has basic understanding about the scientific career stages (assessed by homework); 3.	A student is able to discuss the logics behind the famous scientific studies and breakthroughs, and is familiar with the contemporary requirements ensuring research integrity, including safety requirements (assessed by homework); 4.	A student is aware of the science intrinsic quality control mechanisms and limitations of those (assessed by homework); 5.	A student is skilled in critical reading, analysing, presenting, discussing and giving feedback on the research done by other authors (assessed by homework, oral report and participation in the academic discussion). 2nd part of the course: 1.	A student is able to conduct a subject-based literature/information search in the following databases: WoS/Scopus, SciFinder, Google Patent/Espacenet (assessed by homework). 2.	A student can plan and conduct a goal-oriented short-term research project (under the supervision of a mentor); 3.	A student is able to analyse the obtained data and outline the results reliably and correctly in both written and oral form (assessed by homework and written report); 4.	A student is skilled in presenting and discussing its own research as well as giving feedback on the research presented by the fellow students (assessed by oral report and participation in the academic discussion).
