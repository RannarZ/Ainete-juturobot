The course of developmental biology deals with processes occurring during the embryonic and post-embryonic development of animals. First part of the lectures and practical works focus at first on the development of male and female germ cells (gametogenesis) and then on the processes of fertilization, cleavage and gastrulation stage (early development). Second part of the course concentrates to the development of germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) and their derivatives and organogenesis (organ`s formation).Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to provide general knowledge on the life-cycle of organisms, with major focus on the principles and regulation of early development.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who passed the course: 1) Orientates in terminology of developmental biology, understands the principle processes of development, and is able to understand molecular mechanisms of these processes in different animals. 2) Is competent in describing the stem cells, sex determination, early developmental stages, such as fertilization, cleavage, gastrulation, and understands the processes occurring/taking place during these stages. 3) Understands the formation process of germ layers and how they give a particular shape to different tissues, organs, organ systems. 4) Can understand scientific articles related to developmental biology at a good level. 5) Is capable of working with microscope and can analyze the samples seen in microscope.
