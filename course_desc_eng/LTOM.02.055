The MSc thesis is an independent written work that is based on an experimental and theoretical scientific research.

Master's seminars based on independent assignments will support the composition of Master's thesis. During the first three semesters, the student will present three assignments and actively participate in at least 66% of the seminars, analysing and giving feedback to fellow students' presentations.

In Part 1 (1EAP) the student will write a popular science paper based upon a master's thesis defended at the Dept. Geography, UT. In addition, the student must actively participate in at least 66% of the seminars. Here and hereafter, the listener has a duty to ask questions, comment and make suggestions to the presented papers.

In Part 2 (1EAP), the student will present the study plan of her/his master's thesis in 10-15 minutes. The study plan must contain the following parts: 1. theoretical introduction (including relevance of topic, its relationship with the research field, and previous literature), 2. objective (including its theoretical and practical motivation), 3. material, and 4. methods. In addition, the student must participate in at least 66% of the seminars, analysing and giving feedback to the fellow students' presentations.

In Part 3 (1EAP), the student will present in 15-20 minutes either her/his thesis's full theoretical introduction or demonstrate the material and methods. In addition, the student must participate in at least 66% of the seminars, analysing and giving feedback to the fellow students' presentations.

A pre-defence will take place a month before the official defence. For this purpose, the student will present a draft Master's thesis to the responsible lecturer one week before the scheduled pre-defence. At the pre-defence, the student will present a 15-minute talk, after which she or he will receive feedback from a pre-reviewer, the fellow students and lecturers.Objectives/eesmärkid:  There will be created conditions that are needed for understanding specifics of the research in a certain speciality, for carrying out research work, and for presenting results.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Within the framework of the compilation of Master's thesis, the student must participate in Master's seminars. The student will possess the following skills after the seminars:  1) knows how to write a popular science paper;  2) designs and manages the progress of her/his thesis; 3) knows how to present ongoing research; 4) knows how to give feedback to ongoing research; 5) has an overview of master-level research at the Department of Geography. As a result of the defence the student: 1) can apply acquired knowledge in formulating scientific problems, in planning and conducting research, in making conclusions based on collected data, and in presenting results in written and oral form, 2) is able to find and analyse scientific information and can synthesise new knowledge for the speciality based on the previously available and collected scientific data, 3) have skills for composing and conducting a presentation in public and to express himself/herself in his/her speciality in written and oral form and to defend his/her thoughts, 4) understands the basic principles of ethics of science and is able to evaluate scientific value and applicability of studies in his/her speciality.
