The lecture course presents an advanced overview of the structure and properties of inorganic substances and the types of chemical reactions. Much attention is paid to the relationships between the properties of substances and their structure and character of chemical bonding.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Discuss the advanced topics of inorganic chemistry.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student having passed the course 1. is aware and knows how to use professional software  2. is aware of the chemical process that takes place in the atmo-, hydro-, litho-, bio, and noospheres 3. knows how to search for information on inorganic substances and reactions  4. knows how to prepare a presentation and conduct a discussion  5. knows how to describe chemical species (with open and closed shells, acids and bases, oxidizers and reducing agents) by their structure and properties  6. knows how to analyze the reactivity of compounds based on sterics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and kinetics.
