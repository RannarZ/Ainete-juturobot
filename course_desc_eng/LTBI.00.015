Introduction into the main methods used in plant physiology. The course gives the theoretical basis for the experiments and practical skills needed to perform respective experiments.

Topics include:
- Absorption spectra and determination of analyte concentration by spectrophotometry
- The acid-base properties of amino acids and buffer solutions
- Basic protein separation and purification techniques
- Basics of enzyme kinetics
- the estimation of compounds (photosynthetic pigments,  phenolics) and activities of enzymes (nitrate reductase, water photooxidation complex) characteristic for plants;
- measurement of the photosynthetic electron transport rate and water metabolism parameters;
- the estimation of soil water capacity and pH;
- the acquisition of basic statistical data analysis techniques.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to give an overview of basic methods used in plant physiology.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course, the students are expected: - to be able to use basic lab equipment used in biochemical experiments. - to be familiar with basic methods in biochemistry/plant physiology. - to be able to interpret the results of the experiments and to compose a report.
