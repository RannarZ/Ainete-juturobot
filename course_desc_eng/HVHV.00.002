Digital environment rapidly changed the traditional framework in the studies of culture and literature. It could be new ways of storing and representing cultural data or understanding the nature of a digital document; an automated text analysis or computer modeling of complex cultural systems under the emerging data-sensitive theories (as the theory of cultural evolution). No doubt the "digital" became a new norm with blurry borders & elusive definition.
The course is planned to provide students with a roadmap in this essentially trans-disciplinary world, that jumps between editorial theories, geographic information systems, computational linguistics, media studies and network science. Far from being exhaustive, this course will overview major fields, approaches and ideas in DH while paying slightly more attention to historical cultural data & text analysis.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of the course is to introduce participants to the diverse Digital Humanities framework; to highlight both theoretical and methodological aspects of "computational turn" in humanities while exploring it's current research landscape & critical reasoning.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course the students 1) will be aware of the main topics, issues and research advances within the Digital Humanities umbrella; 2) will have a general understanding of computational approaches to humanities problems & data; 3) will be familiarized with the range of methods ranging from basic text annotation to  natural language processing, maps  & networks; 4) will be able to plan their own project, apply knowledge for their own research agenda and locate its place in a wider theoretical framework.
