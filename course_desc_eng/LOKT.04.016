The fundamentals of ecotoxicology, which enables to understand the processes taking place in the environment and organisms and the influence of different substances to humans and environment, are dealt with. The distribution of contaminants in the environment and the related problems are discussed and analysed in teamwork. Scientific information and internet resources are used to characterize harmful contaminants as well as methods of determining toxicity and ecotoxicity.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give an overview about the fundamental issues of ecotoxicology and problems caused by the environmental pollution. To extend the self-governing abilities in working with science publications and academic literacy by composing review on a topic of ecotoxicology. Using ecotoxicological knowledge, to help develop critical thinking and analytical abilities in global world, where in concurrence of wide range of spheres of activities turns out the real danger to ecosystems.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student 1)	is familiar with the field of knowledge of terminology and investigation in ecotoxicology and toxicology; 2)	is acquainted with legislation in the field of hazardous chemicals and knows main standard documents in European Union (REACH decree) regulating use of hazardous chemicals. Is able to find safety information and use it; 3)	knows how to find information in scientific literature and internet about chemicals and their distribution in the environment causing ecotoxicological hazard on bases of information is able to predict effects caused by the unacceptable use of chemicals; 4)	knows how to characterize the distribution of chemicals in different media and analyse scenarios and results being incidental to the environment; 5)	knows how to characterize and carry out analysis of chemicals by their substantial properties (persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity) and find appropriate information; 6)	knows how to analyse substantial properties of chemicals and to characterize and predict the impact of chemicals in teamwork with colleagues; 7)	knows the basis for classification of chemicals; 8)	is familiar with the processes of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics in organisms and knows how to characterize and classify toxic impact caused by hazardous chemicals; 9)	knows basic principles of implementation of ecotoxicological tests and i able to use the results of tests for determination of safe amounts of chemicals for exposure in the environment; 10)	is familiar with problems of monitoring of environmentally hazardous chemicals and determination of risks connected with their usage.
