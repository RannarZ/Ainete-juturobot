Taxonomy, morphology, physiology and genetics of microorganisms. Microflora of environment and human organism. Microbial pathogenicity and virulence. Resistance of organism. Antibiotic resistance. Microbiological diagnostics, prophylaxis and treatment of infections, caused by several microorganisms - coccal and airborne infections, intestinal and urinary tract infections,  anaerobic  infections, spirochaetoses, fungal infections, infections caused by protozoa, , stomatological infections and virosesObjectives/eesmärkid:  The course gives knowledge  on morphology, physiology, genetics of microorganisms; on immunology, specific prophylaxis and chemotherapy. Overview of infectious agents; microbiological diagnostics, treatment and prophylaxis of infections, caused by themLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  At the end of the course, the students should be able to: 1. List the pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, vira, fungi, protozoa), their general characteristics (morphology, physiology, genetics), classifications and nomenclature; 2. State the normal microbiota of the human body and describe the host-microorganism interactions; 3. State the pathogens' sources and modes of transmission;  4. Describe the mechanisms of immunity against pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms, and describe the pathogenesis of the major infectious diseases; 5. Apply the methods of sterilization and disinfection to prevent and control infections; 6. State the suitable antimicrobial agents for treatment and vaccines available for prevention of communicable diseases; 7. Use the correct method of collection, storage and transport of clinical specimens for microbiological investigations; 8. Recommend the laboratory methods for microbiological diagnosis, perform the basic laboratory procedures for identification of pathogens (microscopy, cultures, immunological and molecular methods) and drug susceptibility testing; 9. Plan and interpret laboratory investigations for the diagnostics of infectious diseases and to correlate the clinical manifestations with the etiologic agents.
