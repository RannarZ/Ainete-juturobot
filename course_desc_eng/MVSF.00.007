The course provides students with getting to know orienteering as an interesting possibility to be physically active. During the web-based course are handled the basics and symbols of orienteering. As the practical assignment, student has to participate in at least six Orienteering Wednesdays (on its longest course), organized by Seiklushunt. Participation in other orienteering events also counts, in case this has been agreed with the lecturer. Following each orienteering event, the short analysis on one's progress there has to be handed in for the agreed date.
