The laboratory course will cover the determination of main characteristics of the plasma, plasma based diagnostic methods and several plasma applications. First part of the works investigates the effect of gas composition, pressure and current on the glow discharge and on the plasma characteristics (temperature, charge density, electric field strength). Emission spectroscopy is used for the determination of plasma temperature. Tuneable diode laser will be used for the recording of the shape of the argon absorption line which allows the determination of the concentration of species. The plasma applications are covered by the studies of laser ablation and laser induced plasma and their use in materials science and diagnostics. Low-temperature plasma applications will be investigated by the example of surface and gas treatment by barrier discharge devices.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the laboratory course is to give overview of the main diagnostic methods used in the plasma studies and to give the hands on experience on several plasma applications. The laboratory experiments will support the theory covered in the lecture course Plasma Physics and Applications. The laboratory course is also useful for students from other fields of physics and materials science who are using plasma based methods in their work.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  In the course of the practice works, the student: 1. has experience with plasma equipment used in various plasma technological applications and with measuring equipment used for the characterization of plasma equipment in the laboratory;  2. formalizes the results of the practical work and presents the results in front of other students and teaching staff, thus developing writing and oral self-expression skills; 3. understands the main safety technical aspects of working with high voltage, lasers and gases.
