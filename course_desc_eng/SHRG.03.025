International law is traditionally concerned with inter-state relations, but nowadays it involves likewise international organisations and, to a lesser extent, also natural and legal persons. The course provides a broad understanding of the central principles and main branches of international law, e.g., jurisdiction, immunity, state responsibility, peaceful settlement of disputes, law of treaties, diplomatic law, law of the sea and use of armed force. In addition to the theoretical foundation, relevant practices of states, courts and international organisations are examined in connection with discussed topics.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To provide an understanding of the central principles and main branches of international law and to develop the skills necessary to assess the conduct of international actors from international law perspectiveLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who has passed the course is able to: -- Explain the central principles of international law -- Describe the sources of international law -- Understand the relation between international and national legal systems -- Identify the subjects of international law -- Find and apply the substantial regulation of the main branches of international law -- Solve hypothetical legal cases concerning international law
