Course about the fundamentals of neurochemistry. Detailed study of chemical transmission, including metabolism, neuroanatomical distribution, pharmacology, and functions of neurotransmitters. There is also overview about neurochemical methods available at the chair of bioorganic chemistry of UT.  All attendees have to present report about connections between his/her studies and neurochemistry.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give overview about chemical processes in nervous system. Special attention will be paid on the mechanisms of functioning of different receptors and their effector systems, but also  on methods used in these studies.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who passed the course successfully: - knows general structure of receptor systems and is able to find more specific information about these systems. - knows general methods of neurochemistry and their possibilities; - Is able to find connections between his/her studies and neurochemistry;
