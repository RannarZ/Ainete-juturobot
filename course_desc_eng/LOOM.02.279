The course covers major aspects in soil and water microbiology. Lectures are divided into tree major sections: habitat and organisms (diversity, microbial ecology), microbially mediated  transformations (biogeochemical cycles), and applied topics. The section of applied topics includes following themes: public health microbiology,  methods in soil and water microbiology, and environmental technologies based on microbial activities.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course gives general overview of soil and water microbial communities and their diversity. Also microbially mediated transformations (biogeochemical cycles), and applied topics (public health and environmental technologies based on microbial activities) are covered.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student is familiar with basic terminology in environmental microbiology and methods. Basic knowledge of biogeochemical cycles, and interactions of these cycles is obtained. Understanding of the role of microbes in different ecosystems and differences in microbial communities in various habitats. Public health related microbial parameters are acquired.
