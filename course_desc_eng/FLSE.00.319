Lectures give an introduction to the general principles of academic research, an introduction to the methodological foundations of semiotic and its related discussions in contemporary semiotics, as well as some principles of semiotic modelling. Lectures also give a more thorough introduction to some research methods in semiotics. The texts that are discussed in the seminars are chosen first in order to provide the students with an understanding of the structure of a scientific text and the presentation of an argument, as well as the implicit rules of a discourse within the discipline; and, secondly, in order to offer a closer introduction to different research methods within semiotics. Written tasks and practice learning develop practical skills of individual academic research.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course (1) provides students with an introduction to the methodological principles of semiotics as a discipline, the principles of semiotic modelling and research methods within the discipline; (2) provides students with an introduction to the general principles of academic research and elementary knowledge in the preliminary steps in academic research: modelling, formulation of hypothesis, formulation of research questions, definition of a research problem, defining an object of research, principles of critical reading; (3) develops practical skills of academic research necessary for individual research papers that students have to complete later during their studies through practical tasks and discussion seminars.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student (1) has the knowledge of the main principles of academic research; has developed practical skills necessary for academic research; knows the methodological principles of semiotics as a discipline; knows the principles of semiotic modelling; has an understanding of the principles of modelling in different theoretical approaches in semiotics; has an understanding of various models of research and analysis within semiotics; has an understanding of different domains of semiotic analysis and specific models within these domains; is able to model, formulate and further define research problem and research question(s).
