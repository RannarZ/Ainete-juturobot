Introduction to bioinformatics is meant to those whose everyday work is not related to computational biology, jet. The course gives review about methods used in bioinformatics, also, how to formulate relevant biological questions able to answer using bioinformatic approach. We do simple nucleic acid and protein sequence analysis; using sequence- and literature databases and perform keyword searches. Perform sequence similarity searches, retrieve sequences and perform two sequence alignments. During this course students acquire practical skills of using programs in web and Linux server and theory behind them.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To give an overview about basic trends and used methods of bioinformatics to audience whose main field is not related to computational biology; to learn data mining from databases of biological sequences, to perform sequence similarity searches, to create two sequence alignments and primer design with web-based programs; te get basic skills in using Linux server command-line tools.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Participants are trained to combine different databases for digging information about gene, protein or organism, to assess quality of sequence databases, to perform sequence similarity searches and to save sequences in appropriate file format; participants are trained to perform two sequence alignments and they know how some basic two sequence alignment algorithms are working; they are trained to design primers using web-based programs and to evaluate and interpret results of used programs and/or obtained from web sites; they will get basic skills in using Linux server command-line tools.
