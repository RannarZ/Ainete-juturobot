The course consists of two blocks. First part introduces important theoretical concepts in international macroeconomics - international risk sharing and intertemporal consumption substitution. These concepts are used to understand current account dynamics and to discuss which are causing the observed deficits and surpluses. The concepts are also used to understand why countries borrow, how much they can borrow, what are the incentives for paying back the loans and when countries go or decide to go bankrupt.  

The second part of the course gives the basics for understanding and working with Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models that belong to the standard toolkit in macroeconomics. The course provides tools for solving models with pen and paper and on computer using software package and programming language Matlab. These models are then used to answer questions such as how to eat cakes, harvest trees, smooth consumption over time, and how do technology, preference and government spending shocks affect the economy.

Students are expected to read academic papers and write referee reports, solve exercises with pen and paper and on computer, and discuss issues in the economy using models studied during the course.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The purpose is to provide students with selected state of the art macroeconomic tools that help to understand the economy.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After taking the course the student has acquired the following skills and competencies: - understands the role of international risk sharing and intertemporal trade in open economy macroeconomics; - can analyse the drivers of sovereign debt and bankruptcy;  - understands the basic concepts of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models; - can use simple DSGE models in the analysis of the economy; - can read critically contemporary academic papers in macroeconomics.
