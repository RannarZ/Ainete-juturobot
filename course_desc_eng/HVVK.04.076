The class promotes continuous self development and willingness to discover, experiment, play, form and create with movement. In classes we learn the parallelism and connections of movement and thinking, paying attention to our own complicity or simplicity. We deal with processes and choices between live imagination and human body which lead to immediate image imitation without thinking about movement sequence. I invite students for intuitive choices, using conscious control and decision during movement.
We discover origins of movement, try to enter different roles and thereby find ourselves in new activities - all which lead to the expansion of imagination. We become more aware and skilled, working in group.
.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course introduces the essence and possibilities of improvisation, encouraging students to move freely and improvise spontaneously.
