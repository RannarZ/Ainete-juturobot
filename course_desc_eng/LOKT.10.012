The course gives basic understanding of structures and chemical properties of biomolecules (amino acids, proteins, lipids, mono- and polysaccharides, nucleic acids). We give introduction into enzymology and most important metabolic pathways. During the lectures and seminars we discuss specificity of biochemical reactions, but main attention will be paid on the chemical nature and mechanisms of reactions in biological pathways.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Developing a basic knowledge of the chemistry of biomolecules and providing an insight into some metabolic reactions. The acquired knowledge enables the application of knowledge of chemistry to understand and implement processes involving biological materials and/or biochemical reactions. Development of oral professional self-expression in presentations of studied materials to fellow studentsLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who passed the course successfully: -	knows the general structure and chemical properties of main biomolecules; -	knows general principles of classical methods of biochemistry; -	Is able to describe general catabolic pathways of biomolecules in terms of organic chemistry; -	Has acquired the basic concepts of the biochemistry of metabolism and has an overview of the most important metabolical pathways. -	Is able to use physico-chemical approach for the characterization of biochemical processes and explain this to the wider public.
