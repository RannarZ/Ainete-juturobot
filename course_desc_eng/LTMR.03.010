The course covers the structure, topology of the bacterial genome and the various DNA elements that make up the genome, such as plasmids, transposable elements, the CRISPR-Cas system, integrons and introns. The importance of DNA elements in the adaptation of bacteria to environmental conditions and the functioning of the elements are explained.
An overview of the collective behaviour of bacteria and the virulence mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria on the example of Salmonella enterica, the necessary processes such as attachment and biofilm formation.
In addition, an overview of the cell surface properties of bacteria, which is necessary for attachment, biofilm formation and the development of chronic infections. The main bacterial transport systems and vesiculation, which are important processes for the group behaviour of bacteria, are discussed.
Lectures practice the application of knowledge and model experiments.Objectives/eesmärkid:  .Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students passed the course: * can use theoretical knowledge of bacterial genome structure, elements, transport, and gene expression and apply them to create a reporter system to study bacterial physiology, * evaluate the stability of plasmids and choose different plasmids for laboratory work, * able to use fluorescent lamps in research work., * can critically evaluate the reliability of reporter systems.
