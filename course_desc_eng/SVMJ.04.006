The course starts with an introduction to R - one of the most powerful data analysis and visualisation language, that has been taking over both business world and academia. R is open source software, but is frequently mentioned to have a rather steep learning curve. We will overcome this together. We will go through the modern R workflow starting from data aquisition and munging and ending with publication ready visualisation of our data. There will be a shorter introduction to alternatives like Tableau.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the subject is to give participants practical ability for the whole process of data analysis starting from data wrangling and initial visual analysis to publication-ready data visualisations in R.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Practical working knowledge of R and RStudio.
