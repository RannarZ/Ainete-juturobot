As part of the discrete mathematics course, the basic concepts and basic methods of proof are briefly reviewed, and then two topics are discussed in depth: graph theory (Euler and Hamiltonian graphs, correspondences and covers, edge and vertex coloring, etc.) and combinatorics (addition and multiplication rule, elimination method, generating functions, probabilistic proofs, etc.).Objectives/eesmärkid:  Deepen the necessary basic mathematical knowledge and develop the ability to think structurally and abstract.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student who completed the course: - uses the basic concepts of discrete mathematics (graphs, trees, functions, relations) and their main properties when constructing proofs - formalizes the problems encountered in practice as tasks of graph theory and combinatorics - understands mathematical proofs of medium complexity in the field of graph theory and combinatorics - checks the correctness of mathematical formulas and fills in the smaller gaps in them - constructs simpler proofs himself
