The course provides theoretical and practical basis of knowledge about general pathological processes and organ-specific pathomorphological alterations, necessary for proceeding into the study of clinical disciplines. The course is divided into three topics: The tumors, General pathology (details the basic mechanisms of injury to cells and tissues, their reactions as well as the body's means of response and reparation) and Anatomical surgical pathology (teaches diagnosis of disease based on pathomorphological alterations in different organ systems).
The sources of theoretical knowledge are the textbooks and presentations, videolectures and self-assessment tests represented in the Moodle learning platform. For learning of microscopic alterations, the database of digital microscopy slides with tutorial videos is available in the Moodle, grouped according to the topics. The course will emphasize on oral pathology, including the changes in oral cavity in general diseases.
In seminars and practical classes, description of cases, their analysis and integrating into formulation of diagnostic hypothesis is practiced both orally and in group activities.
Participation in seminars and practical classes is mandatory. The students have to complete all tests, assessments and practical tasks by terms.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of pathological anatomy course is to provide theoretical and practical knowledge about the causes (etiology), the mechanisms by which a causative agent leads to disease (pathogenesis) and the associated alterations of structure (pathomorphology); to develop skills of observation, interpretation, and integration needed to analyze human disease; to teach comprehensive medical reasoning skills so that the student would become able to understand the associations between the morphological changes and their etiopathogenetic mechanisms as well as clinical symptoms and consequences; to teach interpreting of morphological findings especially in oral cavity and its use in stomatological diagnostics.  The course provides knowledge in pathology for working as a dentist.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who graduated the course getting at least the minimal grade: knows terms, definitions and names of most important diagnoses in pathological anatomy; is able to make associations between macroscopic or microscopic pathomorphological changes and their etiopathogenetic mechanisms as well as clinical symptoms and functional consequences to the organism; can distinguish pathomorphological changes of oral diseases and the most frequent general diseases from normal findings and evaluate them in the context of clinical classifications; can formulate logically the pathogenetic reasoning of the diseases; collaborates within the groups in order to solve clinical cases.
