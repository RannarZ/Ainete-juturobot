Biochemistry II is a basic course of dynamic biochemistry. The reactions of major catabolic and anabolic  pathways are analyzed and their most important aspects of regulation are studied. An integrated picture of  metabolism on a whole cellular and organism level is given.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course covers the basic metabolic network  of the  biochemical reactions in the living cell and the most imortant aspects their regulationLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course the students are expected to understand the network of metabolic reactions and to analyze the most important principles of its regulation. The students are expected to understand the connections between biochemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry and to understand the role of biochemistry in the living world
