The participants are expected to be at CEF B2 level and have intermediate digital competencies (see  https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC106281/web-digcomp2.1pdf_(online).pdf). Before the course starts, students need to sit the placement test on the course's Moodle page to see whether the course is suitable for them.

During the course students develop their critical reading and thinking skills by reading/listening to different texts (extracts of academic texts, articles, essays, academic lectures, presentations, interviews, dialogues), do grammar/vocabulary exercises, sit progress quizzes, participate in online discussions, and make short presentations. A variety of extra tasks is offered, so students can diverge from the core content to meet their more specific needs. The topics covered in the autumn term are multiple intelligences/learning styles, the brain, culture and things that make humans different from animals. The study group can put together their grammar curriculum. The course ends with the end-term test and a video presentation. Compulsory independent work, quizzes and message board discussions are the prerequisites to the end-term test.
