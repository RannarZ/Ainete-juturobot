The course gives an overview of the role of materials' science in the modern technological society as well as different materials and their importance in high-technology applications. The structural, mechanical, thermal, electrical, magnetic and optical characteristics of the materials are discussed. The features and applications of the following materials are presented: metals, alloys, ceramics, glasses, plastics, composites, dielectrics, semiconductors, superconductors, ionic conductors, magnetic materials, luminophors, optical metamaterials, radiation protection materials, dosimetric materials, catalysators, biomaterials, sensor and actuator materials, liquid crystals, shape memory materials, nanomaterials. An overview of most important material technologies and the roles of materials in product development is given.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main goal of the course is to introduce the concept of materials science and its role in the technological capability of the modern society. A primary overview of the main widely applied materials, their characteristics and the detailed underlying causes for their properties will be given.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completion of this course, the student is expected to: 1.	be able to compile a short written summary on object, methods, achievements, problems and trends of materials science; 2.	within the limits of the course, has sufficient knowledge of the structural, mechanical, thermal, electrical, magnetical and optical properties of materials; 3.	can distinguish between characteristics and applications of the following materials: metals, alloys, ceramics, glasses, plastics, composites, dielectrics, semiconductors, superconductors, ionic conductors, magnetic materials, luminophors, optical metamaterials, radiation protection materials, dosimetric materials, catalysators, biomaterials, sensor and actuator materials, liquid crystals, shape memory materials, nanomaterials; 4.	be able to solve the problems within the limits of example exercises available.
