The practical works include determination of the modulus of elasticity and torsion, Brinell hardness, thermal expansion coefficient, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of various materials,  and the moments of inertia for some bodies.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to teach the mechanical and thermal behaviour of various materials, to show the methods of determination of the characteristics of materials, and to give some experience of laboratory work.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the course a student: 1) knows mechanical and thermal behaviour of materials and standard methods for determination of the characteristics; 2) has practical experience of measuring and determination of mechanical and thermal characteristics of materials; 3) can record and process experiment data in case of the topics covered in the course, and present  results.
