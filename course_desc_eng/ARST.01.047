During this course students will learn: physical properties of teeth and biomaterials (density, deformation, mechanical-, optical and thermal properties,  also perform tests of dental materials); basic knowledge about using ionising  radiation (doses, biological effect of radiation, regulations concerning radiology, means of security including dosimetry in dentistry); chemical composition, physical and handling properties of dental restorative materials (base materials, dental amalgams, glassionomers, compomers, dental composites). All lectures are given during autumn term and practical works take place in spring term.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to give basic knowledge about chemical composition, physical and handling properties, indications for use in different clinical situations.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students are informed about chemical composition and physical properties of dental materials, are capable to make choices according to clinical indications and are technically able to  use them to provide good quality treatment. They know  biologic effect of radiation, means of security working with x-ray units in dental clinics and legal regulations for dental clinics working with radiation.
