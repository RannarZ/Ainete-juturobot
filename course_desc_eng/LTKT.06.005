Practical analytical chemistry: general aspects of analytical chemistry, gravimetry, titrimetry (acid-base, complexometric, redox), potentiometry, chromatography (GC and LC, GC-MS and LC-MS), atomic (AAS, AES, atomic mass spectrometry) and molecular spectroscopy (UV-Vis, IR and mass spectrometry), sampling, sample preparation, and principles of method validation and measurement uncertainty estimation.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The goal of the course is to give an overview of the stages of chemical analysis from sampling to presentation of analytical results. Students are introduced to general principles of sampling and sample preparation and to analytical methods like gravimetry, titrimetry, potentiometry, chromatography (GC and LC, GC-MS and LC-MS), atomic (AAS, AES, atomic MS) and molecular spectroscopy (UV-Vis, IR and MS). An overview of method validation and measurement uncertainty is given.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The following knowledge is acquired: - general principles of chemical analysis: analytical signal, noise, selectivity - basics of method validation and measurement uncertainty estimation - methods of chemical analysis (gravimetry, titrimetry, potentiometry, chromatography, spectroscopic methods) and the underlying processes (precipitation, chemical equilibria, transitions in molecules) - principles of sample preparation
