Being a good communicator requires certain skills such as active listening, questioning skills, conflict management and problem-solving skills etc. These are skills necessary for effective communication. For successful professional communication, it is necessary to know how the human psyche works during communication. It helps to regulate your own and others' emotions, communicate more effectively and prevent burnout. During the course, we focus on our own and the client's needs and self-reflection and learn how to effectively use counseling skills in our client work.
