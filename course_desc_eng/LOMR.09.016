Comparative, evolutionary histology and novel scientific, technological and social concepts  based on the biology of stem cells will be touched upon briefly. Practical training deals with histological sections to study the general morphology of basic tissue types.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To study the structure and functions of animal tissues.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  At the end of the course students:
1.	Know the basic tissue types and are able to relate structural characteristics with their functional capabilities.
2.	Understand the principles of histological sample preparation and histochemistry.
