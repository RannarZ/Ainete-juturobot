The first half of the course focuses on the morphlogical structure and classification of Danish words. In the second half, the terminology of syntactic analysis is introduced and the students' understanding of Danish syntax is expanded. Exercises on morphological and syntactic analysis are done to train applying the concepts and theoretical knowledge acquired.

The morphology part of the course covers the following topics: the aim and main concepts of morphology, the principles of morphological analysis, inflection (declension and conjugation) and derivation. 

The syntax part of the course concentrates mainly on the syntactic analysis of Danish sentences and their parts (Danish sentence structure schema). In addition, Danish sentence structure is compared to Estonian syntax, in order to draw attention to the similarities and differences between the two languages.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to give an overview of the structure of Danish, i.e. its morphology and syntax. During the course, students will acquire basic theoretical knowledge of Danish morphology and syntax and learn the terminology of the field. Practical exercises are done to train applying the terms and theoretical knowledge acquired. The course aims therefore to expand the students' knowledge about Danish grammar and offer the necessary skills for linguistic description of Danish, thus improving their command of the language.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing the course, the student:  - understands the formal structure of Danish and compares it with other languages from both theoretical and practical points of view;  - conducts grammatical analysis of Danish words and sentences;  - names and explains the most important terminology in the field of Danish morphology and syntax;  - applies the acquired knowledge in practice.
