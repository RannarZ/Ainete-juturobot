The course offers an introduction to transitions thinking and addresses the complexity of the interrelated social, technological and/or ecological aspects of solving local social issues (environmental inequalities) or global challenges e.g. demographic changes, climate change etc. We will take a closer look at how to examine and understand on-going processes in change dynamics by bringing together driving forces (leadership, mobilization). We explore approaches to managing the transition, including dealing with the public and interest groups resistance to change. During the course, we will apply a variety of models, tools and techniques in addressing practical societal challenges in communities, cities, regions and/or states to bring about change.
