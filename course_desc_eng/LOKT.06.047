The course covers 
-- the contemporary analytical atomic spectroscopy techniques (AAS, AES, XRF and atomic mass spectrometry), their advantages and limitations and fields of application; 
-- the physical and chemical principles of operation of these techniques and the factors that influence the results; 
-- criteria for assessing on the basis of a description about the adequacy and quality of a given atomic spectroscopy method and about its suitability for solving the analytical problem at hand (seminar); 
-- criteria for assessing the adequacy and quality of atomic spectroscopy data presented by others (seminar).Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to give an overview of contemporary analytical atomic spectroscopy techniques. The course introduces the basic principles of the techniques, their practicalities and analysis options, as well as advantages and disadvantages of these techniques.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student who has passed the course  -- has good overview of the contemporary analytical atomic spectroscopy techniques (AAS, AES, XRF and atomic mass spectrometry), their advantages and limitations and fields of application;  -- has good understanding of the physical and chemical principles of operation of these techniques and the factors that influence the results;  -- is able to assess on the basis of a description about the adequacy and quality of a given atomic spectroscopy method and about its suitability for solving the analytical problem at hand;  -- is able to assess the adequacy and quality of atomic spectroscopy data presented by others.
