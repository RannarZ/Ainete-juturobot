Microheterogeneous systems are encountered widely in nature and these are also used in various technologies, including environmental technology. This course deals with surface phenomena (surface tension, adhesion, wetting, adsorption, etc) and with the most important properties of dispersed systems. A great deal of attention is given to the elucidation of the basic aspects of the processes occurring in microheterogeneous systems.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course is intended to provide knowledge of the physico-chemical basis of the processes occurring in microheterogeneous systems.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The major outcome is to understand the basic concepts of the processes occurring in microheterogeneous systems and to apply such knowledge in solving practical problems in the environment. The attendees of the course shall have acquired the knowledge to assess relationships between the interfacial phenomena and the properties of dispersed systems. Students should be able to estimate the main factors that affect the stability of microheterogeneous systems.
