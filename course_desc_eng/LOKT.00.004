The main attention is paid to chemical thermodynamics, kinetics, electrochemistry and solution subject matters. Structure of atoms and principles of chemical bond are also considered. Synthesis of simpler substances and chemical compounds, qualities and physiological effects, that are mostly important to the pharmacy studies, are introduced.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Student knows main conceptions of general and inorganic chemistryLearning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student knows: -main principles of chemical thermodynamics, kinetics and electrochemistry -physical equilibria, aqueous equilibria -structure of atoms, periodicity of atomic properties and main principles of chemical bond -nomenclature, preparation and chemical properties of inorganic compounds needed from the position of pharmacist profession.  Student is able to: -carry out simple qualitative and quantitative laboratory experiments (weighing, measuring different volumes, heating, recrystallisation, preparing of solutions, titration) -draw conclusions based on the results -carry out simple calculations .
