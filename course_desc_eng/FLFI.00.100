Practice is a work-related learning experience that follows university regulations and is guided by a tutor.

All activities should be agreed prior with the practice coordinator Jaana Eigi-Watkin (jaana.eigi-watkin@ut.ee).
Before practice the student must compile a goal driven practice plan. After practice the student must submit a report which includes self-reflection
NB! Finding a practice base is the responsibility of the student and is part of the practice (how to find a job).

This course is meant for BA students.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Goals of the practice course is to provide students with work experience. To learn and develop transferable skills, such as time management, team work, project management and communication skills, as well as develop attitudes necessary for working. To practice implementing knowledge acquired during studies in a working environment and develop proficiency. To develop the skills to critically analyse the content of studies through the experience of internship.
