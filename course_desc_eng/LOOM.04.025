The treatment of theoretical issues in lectures is coupled with practical workshops and seminars in four main areas:
- Practical issues of DNA extraction and purification, choice of the genetic locus for analysis, PCR and sequencing are introduced;
- Handling of difficult material is discussed;
- Skills in computer based sequence assembly, alignment and analysis are taught;
- Phylogeny reconstruction using distance, parsimony and likelihood approaches are introduced;
- The interpretation of phylogeny to address biological questions is emphasised.
The course will be given biennially in spring terms: 2007, 2009, etc.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Laboratory course aims to provide necessary practical background in sequencing DNA from animal organisms and for phylogenetic analysis. Following the course, participants should be able to address and solve
a multitude of scientific problems with the skills of molecular systematics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Following the course, student has acquired necessary theorethical and practical background and skills in molecular systematics and is able to address and solve a multitude of scientific problems with different methods in molecular systematics.
