The course provides a critical overview of the main theoretical approaches to the European Union and the process of European integration, with an emphasis on contemporary political science theories. The EU has been widely regarded as a social science puzzle because it does not fit neatly into existing conceptual categories and disciplinary divisions. Scholars disagree about whether theories located in the International Relations or Comparative Politics discourses are better equipped to explain European integration; these tensions are also reflected in the rivalry between intergovernmentalist approaches and theories of supranational governance. In addition to these, the course covers a variety of other approaches from the three pre-theories (federalism, functionalism, and transactionalism) to neofunctionalism, the debate between liberal intergovernmentalism and supranationalism, neoinstitutionalism, constructivism and theories of Europeanization. Our discussion of the theories of integration focuses on four central questions:
1.	What is the EU (an international organization, a technocratic regime, a form of intergovernmental cooperation, a supranational state-like entity, a federation)?
2.	How does integration proceed and who or what drives integration (member-state governments, supranational institutions, interest groups, etc)?
3.	What patterns of interaction and influence characterize the relationship between the EU and the member states?
4.	How will the EU continue to evolve in the future and what does the European experience tell us about regional integration and supranational governance in general?

In terms of teaching and learning formats, the course emphasizes academic writing and is designed to prepare students for writing an MA thesis (especially the theoretical sections of the thesis).Objectives/eesmärkid:  The overarching objective of the course is to offer a comprehensive overview of the main theoretical approaches to the European Union and the process of regional integration. A critical engagement with the ideas, concepts, and theories that have been developed to describe and explain far-reaching regional integration in Europe enables us to gain a deeper understanding of what the European Union is, how it works, how it came about, and how it might develop in the future. Studying theories of European integration also makes us better equipped to answer the question of whether and how comparable levels of regional integration could be reached in other parts of the world.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Upon completing the course, the students should be able to:
1) explain why we need theories in social science research and explicate how theories can and should be assessed;
2) describe, compare,  contrast, and critically assess the main theoretical approaches to European integration; 
3) be familiar with the historical context in which these theories arose;
4) apply these approaches to concrete cases, problems and developments in European integration;
5) locate and use a wide variety of sources on the EU and the process of integration;
6) write a research paper that conforms to graduate-level standards in terms of the soundness of research design and quality of academic writing.  
7) demonstrate greater competence across a range of general skills, including critical thinking, abstract reasoning, making and defending an argument, as well as clarity of writing and speaking.
