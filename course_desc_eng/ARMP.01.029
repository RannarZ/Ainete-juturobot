The course of "Biology" (10.0 ECTS) gives students an understanding, basic knowledge and skills in modern biology.
Lectures have following topics: modern cell biology and molecular biology, biology of development, genetics, theory of evolution and human ecology (including medical parasitology).
Practicals have following topics: modern cell biology and biology of development, genetics and cytogenetics, human ecology (medical parasitology).Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the  subject is to give students of first year an overview in modern biology. The course is focused on molecular biology and genetics and has medical and applied orientation. The topic of the medical parasitology is integrated into the course.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  As a result of successful passing this course the student knows the basic concepts of all main branches of modern human biology, their applications in medicine, and is able to use this knowledge for understanding and solving practical problems.

After passing the cell biology and molecular biology the student:
1)	Comprehends nature and mechanisms of replication, transcription and translation and their relations with central functions of a eukaryotic cell
2)	Comprehends structure and function of eukaryotic cell organelles and understands their relations with pathological processes
3)	Comprehends major methods in molecular and cell biology and their usage in medicine

After passing the genetics the student:
1)	Knows hierarchical system of material bases of inheritance and functional processes of heredity. Possesses principles of genetics and is able to use these in practice
2)	Knows main types of human hereditary diseases, principles of their classification and frequencies in populations
3)	Knows methods in human genetics
4)	Knows principles of population genetics, its basic law and is able to use these in practice

After passing the developmental biology the student:
1)	Knows mechanisms of mitosis, meiosis, oogenesis and spermatogenesis and their correlations with human pathological processes
2)	Knows processes and mechanisms typical for different periods of ontogenesis
3)	Is able to connect theoretical knowledge with morphological structures in normal development and in pathology

After passing the human ecology and evolutionary biology the student:
1)	Knows morphology, life cycles and distribution routes of parasites; pathogenesis, symptoms, diagnosis, prophylaxis and main schedules of treatment of parasitic diseases
2)	Knows principles of environmental protection and medical problems related with pollution of environment
3)	Knows types of evolutionary theories; levels, factors and regularities of synthetic evolutionary theory. Has knowledge of human evolution
