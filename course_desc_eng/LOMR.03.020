The following subjects will be addressed: energetics of bacteria, solute transport, synthesis of antibiotics and and resistance to them, specific modes of nutrition and metabolic pathways: fermentation of sugars, chemolithoautotrophy, bacterial photosynthesis, aerobic and anaerobic respiration etc. In lectures dedicated to virology, the genetic diversity and classification of viruses as well as principles of viral infection cycle on the examples of bacteriophages - viruses, infecting bacterial hosts will be covered.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main goal: to give basic information on metabolic and energetic processes of prokaryotes, safety issues on working with microbes, and on genetic diversity and systematics of the viruses.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students should be able to evaluate, understand and describe diversity of microorganisms with regard to energetic and metabolic processes. They should know basics of genetic diversity and systematics of the viruses.
