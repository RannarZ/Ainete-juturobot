It is explained how logic is used to reconstruct and analyse arguments and the semantics of natural language.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The students should acquire a solid understanding of the main notions of formal syntax and semantics. They should acquire the ability to translate natural language sentences into first-order predicate logic, and reconstruct arguments and test their validity.
