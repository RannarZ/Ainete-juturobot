In the field of soft robotics, applications of deformable and flexible soft materials are being explored to create structures whose ranges of motion are directly defined by the properties of the materials used to make them. Through this specificity, the field of (soft) robotics is more closely related to materials science and chemistry (deterministic properties) than to mechanical engineering.Objectives/eesmärkid:  Present the principles of the development and application of soft robotics materials from a chemical engineering perspective.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After passing the course student Knows how to apply the most common chemical engineering methods to prepare materials in the development of materials for soft robotics. Can explain the key concepts of soft robotics using appropriate examples and place them in a chemical engineering context.
