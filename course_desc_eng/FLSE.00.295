Topics:
1. What is music and what is musical 'meaning'?
*	Music as an anthropologically universal phenomenon but not a universal concept, even less a universal 'language'
2. How come music affects us so concretely but is so hard to talk about in concrete terms?
*	Different musical competences: constructional (poïetic), receptional (esthesic), intertextual, metacontextual
*	Critical review of existing semiotic approaches to music
3. Parameters of musical expression
4. Musematic analysis
*	A sign typology for music
*	Anaphones (sonic, kinetic, tactile); genre synecdoches; episodic markers; style indicators
*	Vocal persona
*	Music as 'metalanguage' for music: intersubjective and interobjective (intertextual) method, hypothetical substitution (commutation); musical and paramusical connotation
5. Concert music, popular music, film musicObjectives/eesmärkid:  This course attempts to provide a theoretical and practical basis for understanding music as a form of interhuman communication. The general aims are: *	to develop musical listening skills and to increase aural awareness in general; *	to further the systematic understanding of relationships between structural aspects of music and its psychological, social, cultural and ideological qualities; *	to encourage the abilities of connotative thought; *	to relate skills in connotative thinking to more rationalist modes of discourse.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Students who have taken the course: 1. are able to apply concepts and methods presented during the course when attempting to discuss, in an informed manner, questions of musical signification. 2. recognize the role of different musical and paramusical factors in the emergence of musical signification; 3. have a critical overview of different semiotical approaches to music as an object of analysis, and knowledge of most important authors and texts.
