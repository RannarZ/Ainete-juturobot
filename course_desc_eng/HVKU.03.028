Practice abroad is an international work-related learning experience that follows university regulations and is guided by a tutor. All activities should be agreed earlier with the program director (ene.koresaar@ut.ee). This practice course is conducted outside Estonia.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the practice course is to provide students with work experience. To learn and develop transferable skills, such as time management, team work, project management and international communication skills, as well as develop attitudes necessary for working. To practice implementing knowledge acquired during studies in a working environment and develop proficiency. To develop the skills to critically analyse the content of studies through the experience of internship abroad. The exact nature of the practice seminar will be individually decided by student and supervisor, depending on the background and interests of the student. The practice has to fall into one of the following three categories: 1) Practical training in entrepreneurship. The student will go, on the basis of a practice contract, outside the University and abroad to some organisation. They will be assigned a practice supervisor. They will perform the work tasks assigned to them by their place of practice. 2) Project based practice. The sudent will participate in the work of a team abroad within a specific project from beginning to the end. The project must be a response/solution to a specific need or request by an organisation outside the University. 3) Teaching/research management assistant. The student will assist a member of the faculty at a foreign university with a course or research (incl. organizing academic events).Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After completing the practice, the student is able to: - creatively apply disciplinary knowledge and -skills within a working environment; - analyse the practice experience critically (via self-analysis) and integrate the theoretical knowledge with the international practice; - develop transferable skills in an international working environment (such as teamwork, time management, project management, etc); - provide feedback about the internship abroad to the tutor and other students.
