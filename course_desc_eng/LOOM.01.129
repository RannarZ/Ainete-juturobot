The course is divided into a practical part and independent work. The practical part lasts one weekend day, during which participants are taught to observe the richness of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens in the centre of Tartu and to learn the components that create/support the richness (study tour takes place also in a rainy weather). The second half of the day will take place in Oecologicum, where lab methods to survey organisms interacted with plants will be introduced; also a free-form lecture is given related to interesting facts about biodiversity research. As an independent work, during the week the student submits an essay on the pre-defined topic and submits proper observations of at least 10 different species from the city of Tartu (via the PlutoF GO app). The course ends with a concluding seminar.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to "open eyes" in the field of biodiversity and ecology.  For this purpose biota in Tartu urban space will be introduced on the basis of plants and fungi and organisms being (hiddenly) interacted with them; also the main observation and research methods are also introduced, both in the field and in the laboratory.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  1. notices and knows different plant and fungal species in urban space  2. knows the factors what influence (increase) biodiversity in urban space  3. understands the role of biodiversity in urban space 4. can compare the similarities/differences of the urban biodiversity with other ecosystems
