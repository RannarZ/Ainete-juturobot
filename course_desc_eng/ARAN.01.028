The subject deals with structure and functions  of the main organs and organ systems of human body.
Much attentions is given to analysis of functions of the locomotor aparatus - dynamics and kinetics
of joints and muscles.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim is to introduce the student to the key concepts of anatomy that underlie the main systems of the body. To enable students to have an understanding of the function of human body and to give to students basic knowledge in anatomy for learning further subjects.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  At the end of the course, students should:
1.	have a specialised knowledge and understanding of key aspects of the scientific basis of human body;
2.	describe the location of functional systems in the regions of the body. Recall facts related to: the levels of structural organisation of the human body, the gross structure and function of the major regions and systems of the body;
3.	name and describe, in standard terms, anatomical planes and relations and the gross anatomical components of the human body and explain their function;
4.	identify the major organs and musculo-skeletal elements of human specimens.
