The overview of all of the human organ systems (epithelial system, bones and muscles, nervous system and senses, digestive system, respiratory and excretion system, reproduction and endocrine system) structure and physiology are given during the course. The human body is taught as a whole, the relationships between anatomical structures and their functions are taught. The most important regulation mechanisms of human body are dealt with and the practical works of human body and physiology are carried through. Critical and analytical thinking, problem solving and reasoned decision making are developed. Misconceptions and the possibilities of their prevention in the field of human anatomy and physiology are explainedObjectives/eesmärkid:  To give an overview of the cells, tissues, organs and organ systems, their structure and physiology covered in basic school and upper secondary school biology courses. To introduce the person as a whole organism and to give an overview of the most important regulatory mechanisms of the person as a whole organism. Show the connections between construction and function and explain the physico-chemical background of life processes. To develop critical and analytical thinking, problem solving and reasoned decision making. To explain misconceptions and the possibilities of their prevention in the field of human anatomy and physiology.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  1)	knows all the human organ systems' structure and their physiology; 2)	understands the human body as a whole and knows the relationships between the structure and function of organs and organ systems; 3)	Knows the most important regulation mechanisms of human body; 4) is able to think critically and analytically, use his or her knowledge in solving problems and making reasoned decisions; 5) is able to elucidate misunderstandings and the possibilities of their prevention in the field of human anatomy and physiology.
