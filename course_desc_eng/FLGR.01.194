The course focuses on different topics every year (the specific list of topics, authors and text can be fond in the course syllabus, available on Moodle and SIS). In autumn 2016 the focus of the course is individualism, a core value of American culture, and its representation in 19th and 20th century literary texts. Literary texts are placed in a socio-historical context in order to discuss different responses to the tension between the individual and society. Students will read original literary works and trace the major cultural themes in them.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The course focuses in topics related to American literature and culture that vary by semester.
