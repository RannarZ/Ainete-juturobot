This course provides an overview of (past) sanctions and their aims in criminal law. Keeping this in mind, empirical findings are analysed next to theoretical-philosophical and legal sources/arguments to determine if the aims set by theory and law realise in everyday life. Various ways to react on crimes, including restorative justice, are discussed. The focus of this course rests on Estonian system of sanctions, which is analysed both in more general way (possible sanctions) and in detail (technical aspects of sentencing, including sentencing for multiple crimes). Special attention is paid to imprisonment, which has been and still is one of the main forms of punishment.Objectives/eesmärkid:  This course provides an overview of (past) sanctions and their aims in criminal law in Estonia and beyond, and of principles for application of sanctions in Estonia.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  A student who has passed the course: - knows theories of punishments and the purpose of punishment which they support; - names sanctions that are applied or have been applied in the world; - analyses whether the sanctions in reality do serve the purposes the theory attributes to them; - gives a reasoned opinion on ways restorative justice could and should be used; - knows the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and of the Supreme Court of Estonia on application of imprisonment; - understand Estonian system of sanctions, principles of sentencing, and interprets and applies the corresponding regulation of the Estonian Penal Code; -solves practical cases focusing on different aspects of sentencing.
