Blue-Green Infrastructures offer a feasible, economical, and valuable solution for urban regions facing challenges of climate change. This course gives an overview of BGI-s and their functions in urban environment. Introduces principles, applications, and policies of and related to BGI-s. The course deals with climate change and its consequences, with the flood risks and its management and with pollution control using complex sustainable approaches. The course describes measures to climate change adaption, principles of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS), introduces different SUDS solutions for stormwater and flood risk management. This course demonstrates how BGI-s techniques function and how they can contribute to climate adaptation strategy.Objectives/eesmärkid:  To familiarize students with the role of blue-green infrastructures (BGI-s) in the urban environment. To give students an overview about how to adapt and find solutions for mitigation of climate change, stormwater, and flood risk problems. To introduce BGI-s through their different types, benefits and disadvantages, principles, applications, and successful policies. To show, with successful examples, how to incorporate BGI-s into climate adaptation plans and strategies and what factors make BGI-s an ideal part of these strategies.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  Student: * knows the definition and different types of BGI-s. * recognises the best practices of BGI-s. * understands the range of benefits (water-related, climate change adaptation and biodiversity (ecosystem services), aesthetic, and societal) of using BGI-s. * knows the principles of successful implementation of BGI-s and various elements and functions of BGI-s. * identifies the characteristics of BGI-s that make them ideal for climate change adaptation. * has overview of the challenges and barriers to implementation BGI-s in dense urban area. * understands the planning process designed to develop a comprehensive BGI-s planning and implementation strategy. * knows how to integrate BGI-s to the circular economy.
