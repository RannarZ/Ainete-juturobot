This course gives an overview of structure-function relationship of macromolecules participating in three basic genetic processes: DNA replication, RNA transcription, and translation. Other genetic processes (For example DNA recombination and repair, RNA processing, regulatory RNAs, structure of the ribosomes, protein stability) are discussed using specific examples.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main goal of the course is to give the systemic knowledge on the mechanisms of biological information flow.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  After the course, the student will: - explain the relationships between structure and function of macromolecules - know the mechanisms how the genetic information is maintained - describe how gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level - be able to use the acquired knowledge and skills in other disciplines in biology - be able to use correctly the terminology in Estonian
