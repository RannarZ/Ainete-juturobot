Topics covered:
Mechanics in the curriculum of lower secondary school.
Demo experiments and practical works and methods of conducting them.
Application of learning methods of physics in teaching mechanics.
Mechanics in nature and technology.
In the course of work we will familiarize us with all the topics covered in lower secondary school mechanics and with at least one school mechanics textbook.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the course is to prepare the student for teaching mechanics at lower secondary school: to give extended knowledge of mechanics, to help them acquire the technology and methodology needed for conducting practical works and demo experiments in lower secondary school and to give practical skills of applying different methods for teaching mechanics.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student 1. Is able to recognize problems related to mechanics in the environment surrounding us. 2. Uses the laws of physics for analyzing mechanics problems. 3. Can use basic demo equipment and choose suitable equipment for teaching different topics in mechanics. 4. Knows the purpose and principles of working out and organizing practical works in mechanics for lower secondary school. 5. Knows and follows safety requirements for demo experiments and practical works in mechanics. 6. Can find suitable information sources in literature and on the Internet.
