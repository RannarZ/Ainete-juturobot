Fundamental principles of chemical and physical processes, heat and 
work, criteria of spontaneous change, thermodynamic conditions of 
chemical equilibrium and rate, phase diagrams and phase transitions will be 
discussed. Properties of ideal and nonideal molecular solutions will be analyzed.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The main aim of the course is to give basic knowledge in the field of physical chemistry.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student who has passed the course: *	Can compare the properties of ideal and nonideal gases and characterize the nonideal gases and liquids graphically according to van der Waals equation of state. *	Knows the laws of thermodynamics and state functions and can use the thermodynamic properties for describing the various systems. *	Knows the thermodynamic background of chemical and phase equilibria. *	Knows the differential and integral rate laws of simple reactions and can mathematically describe the properties of some complex reactions (consecutive, reversible and competitive reactions, steady state approximation). *	Knows the basic methods for obtaining the reaction order and rate (incl. method of initial rates and method of isolation) and can predict the reaction mechanism on the basis of kinetic laws. *	Knows the basic principles of transition state theory. *	Can describe coexistence of phases and analyze the phase diagrams of one-, two- and three-component systems. *	Can characterize the properties of ideal and nonideal molecular solutions. *      Can use spreadsheet programs for calculations and graphing
