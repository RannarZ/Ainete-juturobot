In this course, the student will gain knowledge about the advancement in the research related to distributed systems and experience by applying the knowledge to a concrete real-life problem. In addition, they will have the choice to work in an environment where they can grasp knowledge from other members of the team. 
The topics are related to distributed systems and they are agreed upon with a supervisor.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The objective of the course is to give students knowledge and skills for performing an application project in the field of Distributed Systems and related areas.  The students shall get an understanding on how to conduct applied project in addressing specific issues related to distributed systems within one of the teams (High Performance Computing team, Mobile Cloud Laboratory or Intelligent Transportation Systems team).Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  On successful completion of this course, the students will have learned: -  How to use theoretical approach in applied research.  - To work and interact with the supervisor and other researchers and members of the team. -  To work independently under the guidance of a supervisor to fulfill an open project.
