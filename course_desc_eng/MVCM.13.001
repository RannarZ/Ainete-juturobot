The module provides practical examples of the activities of nutritionists and their role in the treatment team. Different teaching methods are used. Several times a week, students are expected to work on prepared clinical case material and clinical data. Students are expected to present their findings individually and also as members of their own group. Based on practical examples, the course thus provides an overview of how clinical nutritionists can contribute to the optimization of treatment regimens by using and applying their knowledge. Learners are tested using short interactive tests, in which the analysis of answers plays an important role. The aim at this stage is to increase confidence in solving problems. The student is introduced to macro- and micronutrients and their main biochemical properties. There will be demonstration and analysis of methods for screening and assessing nutritional status and methods for determining body composition.
The basic concepts of nutrition intervention are introduced together with the practical possibilities.Objectives/eesmärkid:  The aim of the module is to give an overview of all aspects of clinical nutrition, to show how basic science determines the patient's requirements, and how to realise these requirements. The student will be taught to identify the key issues needed to assess patients and their needs, placing this process in the context of the medical team's activities. The objective is to apply a practical approach to gathering the necessary clinical information and to balance it with the learned properties of nutrients in their various natural and artificial presentations. The module will provide the student with the materials needed for compiling simple general nutrition prescriptions, which can later be expanded to form the basis of clinical practice. The course provides knowledge about what is in the various therapeutic preparations, so that later it will be easier to understand why problems arise and how to overcome them.Learning outcomes/õpiväljund:  The student completing the module: * Knows the principles of clinical nutrition * Understands the differences between screening and assessment and is able to do both * Has a practical understanding of body composition measurement * Understands the nature of disease-related malnutrition * Has working knowledge of the biochemis-try & physiology of macro- & micronutrients * Understands the composition of artificial enteral and parenteral feeds
