Students are (3) able to choose the most appropriate from above for a particular dataset and research question. Students (4) develop their critical thinking when reading and appraising a research paper. Students are (5) able to write a code in R in order to (5.1) produce descriptive statistics, (5.2) run an econometric model and (5.3) test hypotheses. Students (6) develop their ability to interpret (6.1) statistics, (6.2) output from econometric models and (6.3) the results from hypothesis tests. Students (7) connect econometric practice with the social, economic, political and business reality."}
