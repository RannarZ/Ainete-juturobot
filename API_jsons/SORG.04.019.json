The EU has been widely regarded as a social science puzzle because it does not fit neatly into existing conceptual categories and disciplinary divisions. Scholars disagree about whether theories located in the International Relations or Comparative Politics discourses are better equipped to explain European integration; these tensions are also reflected in the rivalry between intergovernmentalist approaches and theories of supranational governance. In addition to these, the course covers a variety of other approaches from the three pre-theories (federalism, functionalism, and transactionalism) to neofunctionalism, the debate between liberal intergovernmentalism and supranationalism, neoinstitutionalism, constructivism and theories of Europeanization. Our discussion of the theories of integration focuses on four central questions:\n1.\tWhat is the EU (an international organization, a technocratic regime, a form of intergovernmental cooperation, a supranational state-like entity, a federation)?\n2.\tHow does integration proceed and who or what drives integration (member-state governments, supranational institutions, interest groups, etc)?\n3.\tWhat patterns of interaction and influence characterize the relationship between the EU and the member states?\n4.\tHow will the EU continue to evolve in the future and what does the European experience tell us about regional integration and supranational governance in general?\n\nIn terms of teaching and learning formats, the course emphasizes academic writing and is designed to prepare students for writing an MA thesis (especially the theoretical sections of the thesis).", "et": "Kursus annab ülevaate peamistest teoreetilistest lähenemistest Euroopa Liidule ja eurointegratsioonile rõhuasetusega tänapäevastel politoloogilistel käsitlustel. \nEuroopa Liitu on nimetatud sotsiaalteaduste suureks mõistatuseks, kuna ta ei sobitu selgepiiriliselt  olemasolevatesse kontseptuaalsetesse kategooriatesse.
