As all studies are different we can not make too strict rules about what the study/report must or can not be, but bear in mind that the eval points take various contributions into account: \nThe quality of the original study. Do not choose too simple story! It must be a challenge to you and it must include technical things that are new to you, that is the purpose! \nThe quality of your own delving into the topic. There is individual work and effort involved. If not all technical aspects of the study are not comprehensible, it is still OK as long as you understand the aim of the method, the purpose of the technique, and can follow (and present) the general idea of the study. \nThe presentation itself. A 10(?)-minute oral presentation. This is the medium through which you will demonstrate your effort and contribution, so please prepare. It is a shame if you chose a good story, worked hard to understand complicated methodology and scientific reasoning, only to present it in a way that the audience could not understand your message and see your knowledge. Your fellow students will contribute in giving points for the presentations. \nThe \"opposition\". Each student will oppose one presenter. This means that you will read the story carefully before the presentation, you'll have the first chance to ask questions. the idea is not strictly \"opposing\", it can be a debate or discussion, clarification etc. The opponent will also get points for the effort!\nEach of you will propose a question, which MAY be chosen to be a part of the final test, provided that the question is good! If this is the case, you'll probably know the answer to one of the questions in the exam!\n\nHomework 2: Report\nCan be a group work (max 2 persons), in this case, the topics must align - you have to present a single report that has one beginning and one ending, i.e. one whole story\nIt is recommended that the report is based on the publication that you have already worked through and in the same topic. However, your written report must expand on this (use your creativity) - you can, for example, present a written analysis on a topic that has been the subject of the lectures. You have to use and go through additional sources of information. In this case, the source can be broader in topic coverage, such as a review article, web source that presents a given topic, a book chapter etc - anything that helps you generalize, give overview. \nExample: \nHW1: You made an oral presentation about a new METHOD FOR NUCLEIC ACID DELIVERY - a novel type of biopolymer that efficiently transfects cells. \nHW3: Now, because this is a subtopic under a general application of GENE THERAPY, you could make a written report and describe other transfection methods and give an overview about the current state-of-the-art of gene therapy. Alternatively, you could prepare a report of slightly less narrow topic - different methods for transfection, along with their strengths and weaknesses, some possible future directions etc. \nA good report has details, but also presents an overview of the topic. \nPresent your report (oral in the class AND written to Kaido Kurrikoff)\nIf you are doing a group work, distribute tasks between yourselves and adhere to time schedule where you'll meet, discuss, share the progress. Group work can help to more easily cover larger topics, but extra effort must be spent on synchronization."}, "independent_work_assessments": [{"work_type": {"code": "presentation", "et": "Ettekanne", "en": "presentation"}, "due_date": "2021-12-13", "description": {"et": "Homework: prepare a Journal Club presentation"}}, {"work_type": {"code": "written", "et": "Kirjalik lõpphindamine", "en": "final written assessment"}, "due_date": "2022-01-03", "description": {"et": "Written exam"}}], "grade_preconditions": {"et": "Presentation"}, "grade_evaluation": {"et": "Test at the end of the course\nInterim grades/points for the (i) homework, (ii) presentations"}, "debt_elimination": {}, "assessment_scale": {"code": "grade", "et": "Eristav (A, B, C, D, E, F, mi)", "en": "differentiated (A, B, C, D, E, F, not present)"}, "results_available_from": {}}, "resources": {"web_based": {"code": "2", "et": "põimõpe", "en": "blended learning"}, "website_url": "http://moodle.ut.ee", "is_moodle_connected": true, "learning_environments": [{"uuid": "abf6b577-fc49-44fb-880d-753d016512f5", "type": "MOODLE", "code": "LTTI.00.029_ENG", "base_url": "undefined", "is_auto_update": false, "is_default": true, "is_auto_grading": false}], "mandatory_materials": "There is no universal book (yet).
