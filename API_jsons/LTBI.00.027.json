In the first half, basic principles of machine learning and deep learning will be introduced. We will discuss topics such as how to design an appropriate training data set, what components neural networks are built from, what algorithms allow us to train them efficiently and so on. We will also consider some successful deep learning architectures such as ResNet, LSTM, Transformer, VAE, GAN and others, and look at both what kinds of problems they can solve as well as what makes them very effective at doing so.\nIn the second half of the course, the attention will shift to specific applications of deep learning models in the broad field of molecular biology. We will look at how deep learning revolutionised protein structure modelling, including famous models such as AlphaFold. We will consider the use of deep learning in protein engineering, protein interaction prediction, drug design and others. A common theme throughout the course will focus on ways in which we can represent biological molecules as data structures amenable to deep learning, and how lessons from computer vision, natural language processing and reinforcement learning help advance molecular biology.\nIn addition to taught lectures, the course will contain both computer practical and journal club elements.", "et": "-"}, "objectives": [{"en": "The objectives of the course are to:\n- introduce the basic concepts of machine learning with a focus on neural networks and deep learning, including neural network building blocks, key algorithms and commonly used architectures;\n- illustrate the design considerations in building and training an effective deep neural network through specific examples;\n- introduce the domain specific considerations that arise in the application of deep neural networks for the study of molecular biology systems, with applications in protein analysis, synthetic biology, drug design and related fields;\n- provide practical classes complementary to the lecture topics to enable students to experience directly how to train and apply deep neural networks to specific problems;\n- provide sufficient background to enable students to continue with more specialised topics in deep learning, especially with applications in molecular biology.", "et": "-"}], "learning_outcomes": [{"en": "At the end of the course, students should:\n- have acquired an understanding of the major concepts in machine learning and around the use of deep neural networks in particular, and of the practical considerations related to building and using such models; in general terms as well as with domain specific considerations for molecular biology;\n- be able to write clear and well-argued descriptions of these topics, based on the course material and relevant literature from the suggested reading lists;\n- be able to design appropriate training data sets and train and apply simple deep neural networks on a range of data types in molecular biology;\n- be able to continue the study of deep neural networks for applications in molecular biology through research projects.", "et": "-"}], "notes": {}}, "grading": {"independent_work": {}, "grade_preconditions": {}, "grade_evaluation": {"et": "Your assessment will be based on a project that you should conduct and present at the end of the semester.
