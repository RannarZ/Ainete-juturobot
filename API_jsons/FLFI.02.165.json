It was St Augustine who famously wrote, \"What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain to him who asks, me, I do not know.\" Time is an enigma: we cannot see time itself, only its effects in space. How is time measured and represented? How is time related to literary and historical narration? How does the objective measuring of time clash with the subjective experience of temporality? Why do certain times appear meaningful while others are empty? What political and philosophical meanings does the passage of time have? Can one live in different times: mythical and ordinary, sacred and profane?\nThe course will examine key thinkers who have contributed to philosophical reflections on time such as Augustine, Heidegger, Benjamin  and Koselleck.
