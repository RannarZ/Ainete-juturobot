It is possible to take the graded tests for the second time if the first attempt was less than 51%.\n\nThe tests come with a time limit. It is different in the case of each test. When you are in the middle of the test, it is visible how much time is given and how much time is still left.\n\nNB! If the self-test exercise or the graded test require using the letter ß, you can use the following keyboard combinations: the keys Alt 0223 / Alt Gr 0223 or letters \"ss\".\n\nThe period of three weeks has been given to learn each topic. At the beginning of the course, the graded tests of all three topics are available, but after the three weeks for each topic is over, the respective test will close. At the end of the course, there is one additional week given to eliminate any shortcomings. In the case of graded tests, you will find out your results right away (except for the picture assignment: relative pronoun C). Before taking the relative pronoun C test, it is highly recommended to take the preliminary test, which is also available on the page of graded tests. It is possible to see the scores of the graded tests on the menu on the left from \"My grades\". \n\nOn the main page in Moodle, there are three forums available:\n1. News and information - this is the place where the teachers can post additional information about the course.\n2.
