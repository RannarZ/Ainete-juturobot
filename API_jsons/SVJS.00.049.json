There are no formal seminars or classes meant to prepare for the exam. However, in addition to independent reading and reflection, students are also highly encouraged:\n(a) to audit (where relevant) MA-level courses that cover the same literature; this will provide you with a structured context for engaging the literature and discussing thoughts with others;\n(b) to form study groups with other doctoral students when preparing for the actual exam. If you plan to take the exam during a certain semester, contact your fellow doctoral colleagues at least two months in advance about perhaps forming a study group, and then draw up a schedule of meetings (preferably weekly).\n\nAll the required literature is numerically listed and should be generally available through University of Tartu library or its subscriptions. Should there be trouble in accessing the literature then please contact the faculty. \n\nThe exam is composed of two parts. \n\n- The first part is dedicated to the general topic of governance and its digital transformation. \n- Second, the student must prepare knowledge of at least two countries (other than Estonia) in order to demonstrate an ability to apply theories and concepts in an empirical context. Students can choose themselves the relevant country material they wish to use. \n\nThe format of the exam is oral. The student is given five questions, from which he/she must choose two. The student has up to 60 minutes to prepare in relation to each question a 20-minute presentation. During the presentation the student must bring in the relevant theoretical literature as well as examples drawn from his/her chosen countries. After the presentation, the exam committee may ask for clarifications or pose other questions. Generally the exam lasts up to 60 minutes.
