This community might have surprising ways of doing things or weird rules for behaviour that you do not necessarily understand.

What are they generally about? In this lurking process, try to figure out what is the rationale behind the social norms of these communities, why do you think they have developed this way. You should take notes in the lurking process, that will make writing the report easier. Write a short analysis of this community where you introduce the community, give a good overview of what’s happening there. Introduce the social norms that are evident in the group and discuss why do you think these have developed, what function do they serve.

Don't go full caricature but still, try to embody a masculine/feminine (humor the binaries here please) gamer that is different from your usual self.
