Methodology: the researcher must reflect on the chosen of approach and justify it.\n5.

The analysis must be logical and comprehensive.\n6. Aspects of the form: the presentation must have a rational structure and be clearly written. The ideas must not be submerged in a flood of information.\n7. Undogmatic approach: the researcher must be critical about earlier studies, theories, methods, empirical data, sources and the scientific value of his/her work.
