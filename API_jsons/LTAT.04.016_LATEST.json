Other applications include privacy-preserving machine learning (including the training), privacy-preserving image processing, etc.   Zk-SNARKs allow one to prove that some large-scale computation was performed correctly with two additional objectives: (1) nothing is leaked about the private data, and (2) verifying the proof should be considerably more efficient than doing the computation itself.\nThe area is currently very rich in theory (with hundreds of research papers annually) and practice (a few hundred active startups). The objective of the course is to introduce students to this fascinating area.
