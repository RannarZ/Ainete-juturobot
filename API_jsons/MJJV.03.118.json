Many of the tasks of this course call for students` cooperation and promote joint activities. To put the learned constructs and skills in context, two speakers from relevant companies operating in Estonia will be invited to talk about the application of communications to real-life business situations and share their experience with different communication formats and approaches.", "et": "Praktiline kursus, mis selgitab kommunikatsiooni rolli organisatsiooni toimimises ja inimeste juhtimises.
