The course has a final project, either as individual or group participation, that is presented and due at the end of course. Once the students select which project they want to focus on, then individuals and the formed groups would be given various readings related to the project. Additionally, there are four homework assignments will help guide students through the design process of the chosen project. The students are also provided a structure for packaging their final project as a design deliverable. At the end of the course there is a short presentation of each project, which is intended to briefly explain the key aspects of the project and the main takeaways on what was learned from applied theory.", "et": "Kursuse käigus viiakse läbi üks ühisprojekt.

The course utilizes Tartu as a creative city to tap into the potentiality of showing how semiotics can be applied to design thinking and strategic planning in the local environment. Students who want to apply do not need prior skills in semiotics or design, and students enrolled in the semiotics bachelor's and master's programs will see how this course is designed to incorporate theories branching from culture semiotics, biosemiotics and ecosemiotics. However, it should not deter any other students without a background in semiotics to attend this course, much of the mechanics of design and semiotics can be understood as a transdisciplinary approach, which is a unique experience for a wide range of students from various departments to gain insight on the application of semiotics. \n\nThe main theory used to orient the course is around the notion of semiotic components (resources, affordances, competence, and scaffolding). As the students will see, the components are practical, as an apparatus, to examine how meaning-making of an umwelt is embedded and constructed within an environment. Additionally, the semiotic components within an environment serve as a trajective compass to navigate our subjective experience through the paradoxical nature of physical reality and digital reality. Students who attend this course will get a clearer understanding on how semiotic theory relates to real-world problems and scenarios; and although the profession of a \"semiotician\" is usually framed within academia, the students will leave the course with a valuable semiotic toolkit to vividly see how various professions utilize the interwoven relations of design and semiotics.", "et": "Projektipõhise analüüsipraktika eesmärgiks on õppida kasutama semiootika teooriaid ja lähenemisi praktiliste sotsiokultuuriliste olukordade ja protsesside hindamisel, uurimisel, aktuaalsete probleemide määratlemisel, analüüsimisel ja lahenduste leidmisel."}], "learning_outcomes": [{"en": "Students will learn how design and semiotics consist of two processes: the linear, deliberate act that aims at a target and the non-linear, unexpected outcome that emerges.
