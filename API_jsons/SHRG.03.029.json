The third bloc looks at the evolution of and the successes and failures of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy and the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy.

The fifth, and final, bloc scrutinizes the EU's attempt to join the ranks of the global powers through various 'strategic partnerships', and the tensions that have defined these political associations.

Students choose a topic in agreement with the course instructor. For this purpose, they submit a short essay proposal (abstract), which outlines the topic of the essay. The essay topic must be related to the course topics, ideally it should be drawn from the course readings. In the essay, students put forward a proposition (thesis statement) about specific aspect of the EU's role in international politics and provide additional arguments, backed by evidence and examples, in support of this proposition. As well as assessing knowledge of the EU's external relations, the essay component seeks to also assess argument formulation and analytical skills.\n\nEssays must carry full academic reference using a recognized citation style. Further information on what precisely will be expected from students for the essays will be discussed during class time. Students are also strongly encouraged to ask further questions about essays and assessment criteria during the lectures, by email or in person with the lecturer. The essay will be assessed according to:\n\n- the displayed level of familiarity with the institutional framework and policy-making processes of the EU's external relations\n- correct and appropriate use of concepts and terminology\n- the displayed ability to critically assess the EU's role in international politics in in the light of wider academic debates\n- clarity and coherence of structure and consistency of argumentation \n- sufficiency of sources\n- adherence to the formal standards of a graduate-level research paper\n\nThe assessment of the essay is differentiated (A-F).
