Exam will consist of 3 analytical questions (there will be a word limit set, to prevnt it from extrapolating into a longish opinion piece).\n2. First question will address one of the fundamental aspects of the law (e.g. legal personality, inherent powers, responsibility, etc). Second question will ask for comparative approach towards a particular aspect of functioning of the organisations (e.g. immunities, legal/administrative actions, financing, etc.) Third question will be of a practical nature - you will be given a short scenario (bundle of facts) and asked to provide advice pertaining to the facts at hand. (In a nutshell, last question is a very robust simulation of a day-to-day work of a legal adviser. No real time to get your ducks in a row. Quick, short and straight to the point. You are expected to be brief and precise. It is not a place to \"shine bright like a diamond\". It's more of a \"row, row, row, your boat\" kind of a thing.)\n3. As I already pointed out in the beginning on the course - this is the \"big leagues\". So I will compose the questions in a way that I will not really need to observe you online while you answer them (just like the classic \"takeaway\" exam). Point being, it's all in the argumentation and details. Descriptive generalisations will do you no good. \nAs always, any suspicion of plagiarism or other mischievous deeds will lead to penalties. \nI know these are tough and demanding times, but I am sure you will do just fine. You have the materials. Refresh you memory and stay healthy.\nMore details coming soon!\nAleksandr Popov\""}}, "grading": {"independent_work": {"et": "*\tIndependent work with study materials\n*\tWriting a research paper\nIn the research paper, the student analyses one legal problem in connection with the international institutions.

The selected problem should be registered via e-mail no later than on the day of last lecture. The teacher may ask the student to choose another problem if too many students have already chosen the same question. The paper should be submitted electronically as a Word-file no later than on .... via the e-mail address provided by the teacher in charge.

For references, use footnotes. The length of main text (starting from the introduction and ending with the conclusion, excluding footnotes) should be 1500-2500 words. Shorter papers are not accepted or the result is lowered by the discretion of the teacher.\nIndependent identification of clear issues and legal problems is very important. Also, the use of different sources and supportive materials. All used sources must be referred to. In case of internet sources, the full address is necessary, not only the main domain (e.g. www.un.org). A paper based on copy-paste method leads to negative results for both the paper and the exam.
