To help students do this preparatory work efficiently, there will be a workshop early in the course on the use of generative AI for what we can call \"discursive reading,\" where you upload a text to a generative AI interface, and converse with the interface, like you would converse with a tutor. The workshop will teach students how to use generative AI effectively for this purpose. The ability to do discursive reading should make it possible for students to do formative independent work more efficiently.\n\nSummative independent work is graded: if you look at the assessment methods, you'll see that some assessments are done in the seminar itself, some are done at home, and some include both seminar and homework. The following summative (graded) tasks are partly done in seminars and partly at home (additional summative tasks are done in seminars only - see Assessment Methods for a full account):\n3 * short argumentative essay (argument for the context-sensitivity of a novel expression; a speech act analysis; an assessment of how philosophy of language uses data (NB: this last task is based on a diary students keep throughout the course on the use of data in philosophy of language))\n1 * Role-play/Social media sketch development (group work)\n1* Development and recording of a scene that illustrates concepts from the course (group work)\nNB: There is further summative graded work, but it's done in class (see Assessment Methods)."}, "independent_work_assessments": [{"work_type": {"code": "colloquium", "et": "Kollokvium", "en": "colloquium"}, "description": {"et": "(15%) Attendance (you lose 2% for each absence unless a very good excuse is given -- you're allowed 2 good excuses)."}}, {"work_type": {"code": "homework", "et": "Kodutöö", "en": "home work"}, "description": {"et": "(10%) Assessment: Fill out short quantitative and qualitative feedback form at the end of the course.
